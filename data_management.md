# Data Management

This page is devoted to helping scientists I interact with organize their data for reproducibility and ease of analysis. This page is primarily concerned with the creation and storage of [raw data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data) and not with the creationg or storage of derived data that will typically be used for data analysis. To construct derived data, you should be using a script in a software problem, e.g. [R](http://r-project.org/).

To construct this page, I used many sources including 

- [NOAA - Data Management Best Practices](http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/activities/science-technology/data-management/)
- [ESA Bulletin - Some Simple Guidelines for Effective Data Management](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205)


## What is raw data?

For the purpose of this page, 

> raw data is a digital version of non-digital information. 

Basically, raw data is a digitized version of a lab notebook or a print-out from a machine. When a machine provides a digital version, then it is just that file exactly as it came from the machine. 

## Tips in preparing raw data files

The main goal with these tips are to simplify the raw data creation process in order to minimize mistakes and maximize reproducibility.

- Store the data in a nonproprietary software format

    I prefer the use of plain text files for raw data, e.g. comma delimited textfile (.csv). Propietary formats include Excel and Access and should be avoided for raw data. 

- Store the data in nonproprietary hardward formats (and back it up)

    Storing data on the internet is probably the best route here. This can be done without releasing data, e.g. as a private [github](http://github.com/) repository. Some organizations have begun to provide a place for data storage, e.g. [Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/default.htm) or [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/). In addition, all raw data should be backed up, e.g. on your computer's hard drive. 

- Provide a descriptive file name

    The file name should provide details of the place, time, and theme of the data contained within.
    File names should not have any spaces.




## Tips in preparing the raw data

- Write each piece of information only once

    For example, you run an experiment at a bunch of sites that are visited repeatedly. 
    The treatment assignment should only be recorded once. 

    Many times I receive data where this information has been cut-and-pasted to many spreadsheets. 
    Instead you should use a script to combine the site treatment assignment with recorded data at each visit.

- Include a single header row that describes the content in that column

    Use informative variable names as the first row in the data file. 
    Multiple files with similar content should have the **exact** same header rows. 

- Provide an identification to the original non-digital data

    In the raw data, you should have an identification that allows you to go back and check the original non-digital data. 
    For example, you might have a column in the raw data that references the lab notebook number or, perhaps, the filename refers to the original data.
    Including the identification allows you to go back and check the original source to verify that the raw data are correct. 

- Use plain ASCII text

    Use plain ASCII text for your file names, header rows, and data values. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) table from wikipedia has all the ASCII characters in the Glyph column. 

- Record full dates using standardized formats

    In R, the only two Date formats that are recognized are "%Y-%m-%d" and "%Y/%m/%d". 



## What is derived data?

For the purpose of this page,

> derived data is any combination, summarization, or reshaping of your raw data.

Unlike the relatively strict ``rules'' for raw data, derived data can be any format you want. 
I know many individuals use Excel to produce summary statistics, figures, and tables.
Although this is fine, I suggest a scripting language, e.g. R or SAS, that will allow you to easily recreate those statistics, figures, and tables if errors in the raw data are found.
