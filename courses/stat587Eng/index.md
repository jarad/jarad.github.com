## Software 

We will be using the Statistical Software [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
I will be using RStudio as the interface to [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
Although both will be available on lab computers, I suggest you install 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) 
on your own laptop or desktop (or both).

## Course Description

Methods of analyzing and interpreting experimental and survey data. 
Statistical concepts and models; estimation; hypothesis tests with continuous 
and discrete data; simple and multiple linear regression and correlation; 
introduction to analysis of variance and blocking. 

## Course Objectives

- Understand the difference between a population and a sample.
- Learn to use statistical methods, e.g. t-tests, rank sum tests, ANOVA, regression, etc., to analyze experimental and observational data.
- Perform, check assumptions, and interpret multiple linear regression.
- Write, interpret, and critically evaluate statements such as
  - No significant differences were observed between A/H5N1_HA N182K- and A/H5N1_HA Q222L,G2245-inoculated animals, as calculated by comparing the viral titer (Mann-Whitney test, P=0.589 and 0.818 for nose and throat titers, respectively).
  - ... estimate gross carbon emissions across tropical regions between 2000 and 2005 as 0.81 petagram of carbon per year, with a 90% prediction interval of 0.57 to 1.22 petagrams of carbon per year.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisite for the course is previous enrollment in one of the following
statistics (STAT) courses: 101, 104, 105, 201, or 226.
