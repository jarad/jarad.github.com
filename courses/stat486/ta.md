This page is intended to include all information necessary for the teaching
assistant (TA) for this course. 

## Setup

At the beginning of the semester, 
the instructor needs to 

- Add the TA to the Canvas course 
  - Co-Teacher allows TA to construct Canvas quizzes
- TA Add information about themselves to "Instructor(s) Page"


## Background

Spring 2023 is the first time Jarad Niemi is teaching this course. 
Thus many aspects of the course will be in flux. 

### Prerequisites

Students are coming from three different prereq courses:

- STAT 301 (Laura Ziegler)
- STAT 326 (Anna Peterson)
- STAT 401/587 (Jarad Niemi and others)

For students from 

### Previous versions

Previous versions of this course were taught by 

- Lily Wang
- [Xiongtai Dai](https://github.com/jarad/stat486586Materials)

In addition, Heike Hoffman and Jarad Niemi are developing an online version of 
the course for the Master's of Applied Statistics Program. 
[Their materials are available on CyBox](https://iastate.box.com/s/ae4ic5m0beawux1khd1n1oqan2jvm3ht) 
(only available to those we have shared with).

## TA responsibilities

A 20 hr/week TA should 

- study course material (2 hrs)
- hold 2 hours of office hours (2 hrs)
- respond in a timely fashion to Discussion board (2 hrs)
- grade student code (~10 hrs/week)

  
  
## Spring 2023 Plan

### Content

Introduce students to other aspects of statistics while teaching them the 
computational techniques to accomplish those aspects. 
The additional aspects of statistics that will be introduced are 

- Bayesian statistics
- Monte Carlo studies
- Spatial statistics?
- Time series analysis/decomposition
- Statistical learning

Computational techniques

- Debugging
- Data wrangling
- Visualization
- Basic programming
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Statistical learning
- Special data
  - Date/time
  - Text (regexp; natural language processing?)
- Reproducible analyses


### Assessment

Initial assessment will be based on background knowledge. 
These will be assessed via homework assignments implemented as Canvas quizzes. 
In addition, students should develop scripts that can be used on new data. 

I would like students to develop an online portfolio to showcase their 
statistical savviness. 
The online portfolio will contain the following 

- Estimator evaluation: bias, mse, coverage
- Monte Carlo study: SIR model
- Data wrangling: [Monarch Data](https://github.com/ISU-Monarchs/HabitatRestoration)
- Statistical learning
- Project

One question is how early should students be doing their own homework vs 
working with a group. 
For example, should they obtain their own data sets to construct visualizations?
