## Textbook

The required textbook for this course is 

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [R for Data Science (2nd)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)

There is now second edition of this book 

### Additional free textbooks

- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)
- [Hands on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics) - background material


## Software 

We will be using the statistical software [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
I will be using RStudio as the interface to [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
Although both will be available on lab computers, I suggest you install 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) 
on your own laptop or desktop.

## Course Description

Modern statistical computing. Topics may include: data management; spread sheets; verifying data accuracy; transferring data between software packages; data and graphical analysis with statistical software packages; algorithmic programming concepts and applications; simulation studies and resampling methods; software reliability; statistical modeling and machine learning. 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to 

- Wrangle data and construct visualizations to demonstrate scientific phenomenon.
- Implement a data management pipeline, including relevant feed back loops in order to obtain a reproducible workflow.
- Construct R functions and scripts to obtain a stated input-output goal.
- Produce a Monte Carlo simulation study to demonstrate a theoretical probability result.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisite for the course is previous enrollment in one of the following
statistics (STAT) courses: 301, 326, 401, or 587.
