[R code](24-rmarkdown.R) [R Markdown file](24-rmarkdown.Rmd)

Rmarkdown files combine the writing format of markdown with the ability to 
include R code and the output of that code into a single document. 
You can see the Rmarkdown code that constructed this step by looking at the 
[R Markdown file](24-rmarkdown.Rmd).

# Markdown

Here are some basics of the markdown format,
more thorough documentation is available on 
[daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
from the creators of markdown. 

## Emphasis

You can add italics or bold-face using \* or \_, e.g.

```
*italics*
_italics_
**boldface**
__boldface__
```

For example, 
*this* and _this_ are both in italics while
**this** and __this__ are both in bold-face. 


## Lists

### Itemized

- First item
- Second item
  - First subitem
  - Second subitem

### Enumerated

For some reason sublists for enumerated lists need 

1. First item
1. Second item
    a. First subitem
    a. Second subitem





## Headers

Headers can be created in two ways, but my preferred approach is atx-style. 

```
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
```



## Links

To construct a link use 

```
[link text](link "Title)
```

For example, here is a link to the 
[daring fireball syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).



### Images

Images can be included by prepending the link syntax with an exclamation mark,
e.g. 

```
![alt text](file "Title")
```



### Anchor links

Anchor links are automatically created for all headers.
Replace any spaces with an underscore ("_") in order to link to the header. 
For example, here is a link to the 
[Inline R](#inline-r)
section below
and here is one to the [verbatim section](#verbatim).


## Verbatim

Verbatim code can be included by using 3 back ticks, e.g.

````
```
verbatim
```
````

The headers in the previous section were created using this verbatim approach.
If you want to show verbatim content that includes 3 back ticks, you need to 
use 4 back ticks to create the verbatim environment. 
This approach was used in this section.
