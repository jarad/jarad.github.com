- Derive a conjugate Bayesian analysis with Jeffreys prior.
- Implement a computational Bayesian analysis using JAGS or Stan.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisite for the course is previous or concurrent enrollement in [STAT 543](http://catalog.iastate.edu/showcourse/?code=STAT-543&edition=2014-15) or equivalent, e.g. Econ 672.
