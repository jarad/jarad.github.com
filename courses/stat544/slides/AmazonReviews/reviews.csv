This one was to replace the earlier floor model that took a tumble down a flight of stairs.  The thing still works, but some of the plastic parts didn't survive the landing on the concrete floor.

I turned it on to begin using it and within minutes my filter was full. I thought it was odd, but I emptied it and went over what I had just vacuumed and the same thing happened. I emptied the filter probably 10-12 times throughout my entire house - but it was worth it. My carpet is so clean. It feels completely different. Even my boyfriend noticed a difference!

When I called I discovered the hose and any moving parts are not covered because they have wear and tear.  I gave them 2 stars because they did give me a courtesy hose.  She recommended stretching out the hose by pulling it out, wrapping it around the vacuum and leaving it that way overnight. I was also told that the hose was $30 to replace.

I can't speak to longevity because we've only owned it for a month, but here's our experience:Very easy to assemble and operate, including the arm extension.Very effective - empty the canister 2-3 times per vacuuming (appx 1150 sq. feet of carpet in our home).Downside, it's a little heavy, but not any more cumbersome than a regular vacuum.  My wife and I have no problems on the stairs, but if someone were more feeble, you might want to at least go feel one at the store prior to purchasing.I researched the ball vacuums versus this standard Dyson model and it seems to be an even split.  Biggest complaints about the ball vacuum appears to be a larger front end that can make it difficult to vacuum under the edges of furniture without moving the furniture.  Downside of the standard model were its increased weight and the fact that it was more cumbersome.  As mentioned, I haven't found those to be deal breakers.  It just pushes like a more standard model, and we don't need the tight turn radius in our home.I love the bagless concept and the canister emptying from the bottom with an easy click of a button.  Noise-wise, not that bad.  Didn't scare my 7-month old.  But, it is a vacuum, after all.  However, it just seemed to be less piercing of a sound compared with our previous vacuum.Take what I have to say with a grain of salt because my previous vacuum was an eight year old Dirt Devil.  Maybe this isn't as good as other expensive vacuums, but for someone who was scared to lay down the $350 at first and was hard to convince not to just get another cheap vacuum, I have not regretted this purchase at all.  Barring the thing blowing up in the next 6 months, I would not hesitate to do it again.  We have felt a stark difference in our carpet since we started using it.  It feels soft and clean again (not sure our old vacuum was picking up a whole lot toward the end there)."

Since the wand attachment is also the handle, it needs to have a better way to click into place more securely.  I have even tried using the canister handle instead, but because it is so low, it is very uncomfortable. Additionally, when I use the canister handle, the wand attachment is in the way and still falls off.  When I wind the cord, the wand attachment falls off.  It seems like such an easy thing to have the wand attachment lock into place rather than the current design, where it merely clicks into a small space.The suction works fine, and the canister is easy to clean (albeit small), but I can't say that it is any better than competitors.  This is my first and last Dyson. With three kids and a dog, I don't have all day to vacuum.  I need something powerful and quick with secure attachments.  Not worth the money IMO."

We called Dyson the second time it happened and they said that sometimes the suction is so strong that it sucks the rug into it and the that jams the gears and makes the noise. We said it didn't pull on the rug or appear to be sucking it up, but the tech didn't think that was unusual. They taught us to remove this styrofoam liner on the the lip of the vacuum, and 'reset' the vacuum itself by flipping the Floor to Carpet switch on and off 10 times. It didn't help. To this day the vacuum will do this whirring noise. The noise is so loud, my neighbor's have complained. My family AND the dog don't want to be inside when I'm vacuuming because the whirring is so loud it frightens them. We've found no rhyme or reason to the whirring. It doesn't matter what surface it's on, which rug, what it's vacuuming up, whether the cannister is empty or not - some days it's just going to jam, whir, and have to be reset.

It does have awesome sucking power(-which can be a problem on area rugs). It was well packaged and went together easily. It vacuums GREAT on bare floors and seems to do well on carpet. But for $300 I feel it should go under my kitchen cabinets. Most cabinet heights are standard and this would have been a fairly easy fix and made life more convenient for lots of us. Then it would also fit under the front edge of our sofas, again another plus for most of us. And by the way, my kitchen cupboards are a bit higher than standard since we installed them that way because of our height. I also love the disposal of the dust. So much easier than my previous vacuum.I (and my 2 teens who also vacuum)feel that the cleaning wand is a royal pain in the #@* to use. It is awkward to use, and very difficult to put back in place. Each time I think I have it and then go to vacuum, it comes undone in my hand.  and the process for selecting bare floors or carpet seems quite outdated. Maybe the engineers needed to actually use the vacuum for real vacuuming for a period of time before the final product was created. Just saying. You had the opportunity to make a genuinely great product and dropped the ball on some important details. I am also concern about the strength of the plastic used to manufacture this vacuum. Time will tell. Parts of the vacuum seem chintzy.Dyson was not really interested in my comments. The girl at tech support made a big show of taking my mailing info but never sent anything out. That is not impressive. Thanks for showing me that I do not matter. So the next time I am in the market for a vacuum will I purchase a Dyson---probably not---there will probably be better competition out there by then."

I had experience with Dyson before with an animal upright model and was really pleased with that vacuum, though I was not quite ready to shell out those really big bucks. Experience with other vacuums told me that a bagless system was a must, as was a switch to turn the brushbar on and off (like for carpets and hard floors). Based on my previous experience with Dyson, I was drawn back to them, but wanted a slightly less expensive/large model. After reading many reviews and not being entirely sold on the Ball technology (including in-store testing), I settled on the DC33 model.When I received the vacuum, I assembled it and began testing it out. It seemed to work pretty well, though not quite as well as I'd remembered Dysons working. After some exploring, I found that the brushbar wasn't turning when in the carpet mode. I called Dyson support and they recommended turning the switch back and forth a few times and presto, it worked! Once the brushbar was turning, it did quite the job cleaning carpets. Unfortunately, this brushbar issue happens frequently and its not immediately obvious if the bar is turning, so I'm frequently having to turn the switch back and forth and it's getting a little annoying. Hopefully soon I'll try to take it to get serviced to see if this problem can be fixed.The only other disappointing thing about this vacuum is that it doesn't feel as solidly made as the Dyson I used in the past, with a fair bit of play in the bagless canister rather than it mounting firmly in place. Also, the overall construction using a large amount of plastic creates a slightly cheap feel to the whole vacuum.Otherwise, however, I am pleased with this vacuum. I lent it to a friend who used it on hardwood floors and said it was the best vacuum for hardwoods she's ever used. When the brushbar is on, the vacuum performs well on carpets and isn't too loud. The accessories take some fiddling with to understand what buttons and clips do what, but once you get the hang of it, they work quite well."

I have owned it for 3 months and the canister button does not work. I need to use a screwdriver to open it to dispose of waste.2. The wand is useless and can't be used for stairs or corners or dusting. Way too cumbersome compared to my old hoover. (Not to mention, if you have a quick pick-up job for the wand, you have to unravel the entire cord to get to the wand, since the cord locks the wand in place. Then you have to wind the cord up again.)3. Every couple of weeks my machine has screeched to a halt because has been clogged with hair.  The roller does not have a self cleaning feature like some of the other models. (It gets jammed under the roller.) With my old hoover I owned it for 13 years and I only had to clean the roller about once every 2 years.We don't have any pets in the house so this would never work for a pet owner.4. My roller stopped working yesterday altogether, but there was no hair in it. (Very touchy machine.) I let it cool off for a while since I could smell something burning and then it started to work OK again. I think something is jammed is inside the machine.My old monster hoover never went to the shop and still runs. This one has two repairs that need to be made and it is only 3 months old.My only pro: This machine can suck like crazy. It can even get up small glitter dust off the carpet, but since it is so dysfunctional in other ways I can't stand it. Any machine that requires I have two vacuums doesn't work for me.My goal: sell this on craigslist for $200 and take a $200 loss and go buy a new hoover. :(TRY THE WAND FEATURE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS MACHINE.SOOOOO POORLY DESIGNED!"

LOUD GRINDING NOISE!","This vacuum is advertised and described as a multi-floor vacuum, but the truth is it only works on bare floor and wall-to-wall carpeting. Dyson knows this, but chooses not to make it clear in any way prior to calling support.Immediately after taking this out of the box and using it on our rug it made a horrible VERY loud noise that sounded like it was broken.Apparently that is the vacuum's 'alert sound' that something is caught in the roller.The Dyson brand bases their advertising on the creator's belief 'that things should work properly'. Well this is not a vacuum 'working properly'.I called support and encountered a rude representative that kept chuckling about the situation. I don't know why she thought this was funny. Spending this much money on a vacuum and having it be completely unsuitable for my needs is a really poor experience. She had the temerity to say 'that's why we offer a range of models'. If their product descriptions or website said anything about a 'Multi-Floor' vacuum not actually being good for more than two types of floor, and particularly not being good for rugs, I wouldn't have bought it. Frankly, it sounds like they know about the issue but are happy to just keep taking people's money and providing an inappropriate product.She told me to remove the gasket from the base. It helped somewhat, but still made the noise one or two times. My wife doesn't want to use it and feels like she's been betrayed by Dyson. I can't stress enough how inappropriate the support representative was.DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO USE IT ON RUGSAdditionally, the hose is definitely designed in a way that makes it less useful for the kind of tasks I use hoses for.

It seems to look the part of a 400$ vacuum.-My home is entirely hardwood flooring and tile and this vacuum did an excellent job picking up the dirt-As a bachelor, let's be real...I'm not buying bags for vacuums and all that other stuff so a bagless system seems to be the way to go.  The clear plastic bin that lets you see whats getting picked up is also very nice-The vacuum wand in the handle, a feature that ultimately made me drop the money on this.  It works well and picked up anything left in the corners of the floors and ceilings.-  The cord is huge.  I did the whole first floor and most of the hallway on the second floor using just one outlet.-People complaining that it is heavy really need to take a step back and figure out if they are that weak or that lazy.  Seriously some people equated this to basically pushing and pulling a bag of bricks.  If you're 70 years old, then yeah maybe, but if you're in the prime of your life and this is heavy then that's pretty patheticThe cons:-(Minor)  The floor vacuum seems to ride quite low to the floor so it will just push around large particles.  Again the wand is in the handle of the machine and with a click of the button it will just suck that stuff up through the handle.-(Minor)  Yes the floor machine will not go too deep under furniture.  But you could either move the furniture or use the wand to go underneath.  Another gripe based on pure laziness.  Either you want to clean or you don't.  If you do then move the furniture, if you don't then just swipe underneath the furniture with the wand-(Minor)  The extension hose for the wand will take some time breaking in, it is very frigid out of the box.  Until then the main part will bounce around a bit as you extend the hose to the ceiling.-(MAJOR)  The machine will make the most horrid noise you have ever heard from a vacuum when placed over a carpet door mat or bathroom rug.  Apparently it sucks up these unfixed carpets into the system like it would a sock or extension cord.  This is going to be a major problem when I finally get around to getting area rugs for the home.  Mats and bathroom rugs are one thing, I just shake them outside or onto the floor and vacuum that, but a 400$ machine BETTER be able to handle a bona fide area rug. To their credit I emailed them the first night I got it with this problem.  They replied very quickly and stated that there are two pieces on the bottom of the machine that can be pulled out that will help alleviate this problem without costing the machine any performance.  I am a bit weary of this solution because I cannot be the only one who has ever reported this, and if these removable pieces are the problem and will not cause any drop in performance...then why are they in the machine in the first place?I will be pulling out those pieces soon and then testing it out on an old area rug I borrowed from my parents to test this fix.  If it works, then this is an excellent all around vacuum cleaner that will stay at four stars because I can't give it 4.5.  If it doesn't it's a 1 because even though it is great on the existing home...I didn't spend 400$ to have to buy another vacuum for an area rug."

Here are my biggest complaints:1.  It is HEAVY.  I work out regularly and I'm not a wimp, however my right arm is always sore and fatigued by the time I am done with the whole house.2. The canister is filled with the snowy-white fur of my dog, but that is it.  The canister contents are still white.  Where is the dirt?  My old vacuum dumped disgusting dark grey dirt.  The fur had always been turned black by the dirt.  I am so disturbed that there is no dirt in the canister.  That means it it still in my carpet.3.  It has a very tall base, meaning it does not have a good lip to get under the bottoms of dressers, beds, couches, etc.  I don't expect it to fold flat and go all the way under the bed, but previous vacuums have allowed me to go at least 2-3 inches under things.4.  It is expensive.  I will gladly pay that for a phenomenal vacuum, but paying $350 for something that leaves my carpets dingy and filled with dirt is offensive.I gave it two stars because I have to admit it does an excellent job on hard floors.  It doesn't kick stuff backwards like other vacuums. The attachments are fine as well.  It also has a long cord length, which is appreciated.

While many may get romantic about suction and features, I want a tool that helps us speed through the necessary Saturday morning efforts so we can move on to more enjoyable weekend exercises.  After three months with the DC33, we either have a lemon or I will simply question the ($400) hype as it is a finicky machine that requires kid-glove use and frequently clogs; seriously, we catch our breath if the machine is accidentally bumped on a stationary object concerned if it will continue to work.  We use the device for a 3,500 sq foot house that is 25% carpet and the remainder hardwood floors, and we don't have pets that might confound the machine's performance.  Disappointing, to say the least."

We've had a Bissel bag-less vac for the last 8 years and over the past few months, I've noticed how poorly it has started performing.  So instead of searching for a replacement in the $200 range, we decided to invest in the best and purchase a Dyson.I could not be more impressed with how powerful this vac is.  The old Bissel picked up a noticeable amount of dirt.  The Dyson, however picks up almost double the amount, based on how full the dirt bin is.  We own two dogs (Boston Terrier and Pug) and the amount of hair that was picked up in two bedrooms and a hallway was tremendous.  Although our carpet needs a good shampooing, it looks noticeably cleaner with just one run with the Dyson.Our home is two stories with laminate floors at the bottom.  The Dyson does a great job with this too.  Typically, I would vacuum the floor before mopping it.  With my old vac, there were still traces of dog hair, no matter how thorough I think I was.  They Dyson seems to have picked up a lot more, resulting in far less dog hair when I get down to the mopping.  Also, our Bissel had a shorter power cord; I couldn't do the entire living and dining room without having to unplug.  The Dyson cord is longer and I don't have to unplug more than once per floor.I only have two minor complaints.  The first is that you have to push down on the front of the vac in order to tilt the machine when you use it.  I'm so used to stepping on a 'trigger' in the back so this is a minor inconvenience.  Secondly, the hose and attachment is a bit clunky for my taste.  I've read that the hose needs time to 'break-in' so that might be the issue but it does seem a bit unwieldy when doing stairs.  Still, the powerful suction on the attachments more than make up for it.With a five year warranty and no filters to replace, I think that the Dyson will be an overall great value.  If you have more than a one bedroom place, I'd highly recommend purchasing it.  It makes cleaning so much easier and more efficient.  It is quite expensive (more than three times the cost of a Hoover, Eureka, etc.) but in my opinion it will be well worth it.  Considering I vacuum at least once a week, over the course of five years that's over 250 times I'll be cleaning better."

In fact, I was in love with my new Dyson when I vacuumed all of our carpets. The DC 33 is wonderful at picking up disgusting amounts of dirt on carpets that were previously 'cleaned' by my old vacuum. I am returning my Dyson because it simply cannot do one important thing- vacuum area rugs. I have many area rugs in my house due to the downstairs being all hardwood and tile (the Dyson does great on bare floors). When I went to vacuum the area rugs, the Dyson made the loudest grinding-screeching noise as if something was caught in the vacuum. I immediately stopped and checked the vacuum - no obstructions. I then tried again and encountered the same problem. I then looked on Dyson's website to see if there was an answer for my problem and unfortunately they acknowledge this design flaw and their solution is to simply vacuum those rugs in only the bare floor setting. That is not an acceptable solution for me - I paid $400 for this vacuum and I expect it to properly vacuum my area rugs (in bare floor setting the vacuum only suctions and the bar does not turn so the fibers in my area rugs don't properly get cleaned and fluffed). Also, my area rugs are very large, multiple 8x10's and an 10x 14, they are heavy and of various pile lengths so it's not like I'm trying to vacuum some flimsy 1x3 rug. This Dyson is not a multi-floor vacuum, only a dual floor: carpet and bare floors. Another recommendation by Dyson was to purchase one of their even more expensive models around $650 that does not have this problem. Sorry Dyson, for $400 I should be able to vacuum my rugs so you are getting returned. My search for a great vacuum that doesn't break the bank continues...."

The profile of the vacuum is high, so it doesn't fit under anything, and the odd handle-integrated wand doesn't fit under things either. The on-board tools are cheap.But the final straw was when the roller started making a sound like washers in a blender a mere 6 weeks after purchase. And I was out of town for three of those weeks, so it really only had 3 weeks of once-weekly use. So essentially, it ran for about 3 hours.

Some pieces of the Bissell finally started to fall apart so, after reading many reviews, decided to purchase the Dyson DC33.  I was not initially impressed, but continued to use for a few weeks to see if I could get used to the things that bothered me.  I really wantedt o love this vacuum but, alas, it's going back.PROS:- Fairly light weight for its size.  Easy to carry up stairs.- Long cord, was able to do a few rooms without having to replug.- Easy to empty canister, although I can see that smaller lint/dust would start to accumulate on the filter in the middle and would have to be manually removed.CONS:- I know I'm going to get flak for this, but I was not impressed with the suction.  My Bissell's suction was just as good, if not better.  For that price, I wanted to be able to pick up a small child if necessary.  Not really, but you get the point.- Unable to vacuum under the bottom of kitchen cabinets or furniture.  Some other reviews had mentioned this, but I don't think you know how much this will annoy you until you get it home and are unable to thoroughly vacuum without having to use the wand.  Which brings me to my next con...- Who designed this wand??  I'm sure once you get used to how it works it wouldn't be as big of a deal.  But after using for a few weeks, I was amazed at how often I would just want to use the hose/wand for a small job, but would heave a sigh when I remembered what I needed to do to get it ready to go.  Plus, its design does not allow you to easily use on things in close range. Doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but again, get it home and it may drive you crazy.  It did me.- Last, but certainly not least, when vacuuming straight on, due to the front lip of the vacuum, you are unable to vacuum no closer than an inch and a half to an item or wall in front of you.  In many cases, you can turn the vacuum and run it on its side by the wall or item.  But in quite a few areas, it's not possible to manuever the vacuum into that area, and therefore, you'll be left with an unvacuumed edge.  You could use the hose and wand, but I've covered what a pain in the arse that is.I so wanted to be thrilled with this purchase, but I just don't see where Dyson gets off charging that price for a vacuum with this many flaws."

I love the clear container to point out to my husband how much it's picking up and why the price he paid for it was WELL worth it. But that's my husband, I think the only time he ever thought the carpet was actually dirty was when we had a red wine spill on white carpet - he needs a neon sign to point out where dust is - so this is the best vacuum for that.Amazon is great. I was a little hesitant to order such a big and expensive piece because of the hassle if it needed to be returned - but that's just a hold over from inferior products in the past.

Because the accompanying tools are all designed to attach to the wand, using them means standing 3-4 feet away from whatever you're trying to clean. My next move is to purchase the accessory kit (http://www.amazon.com/Dyson-Home-Cleaning-Kit/dp/B002OHKLJW/ref=pd_sim_hg_1 - it seems like these tools really should be included with the base model of the vacuum) so that I can get the adapter to attach the tools directly to the hose.

I never realized what other vacuum didn't pick up till then. It was like night and day. I keep my home pretty clean but was almost disgusted how much the Dyson picked up. I have a lab who sheds all the time and this vacuum picked up the hair so well. It was amazing. With the clear bin, you can see just how well it works. I would recommend emptying the canister into a bag outside to keep the dust you just vacuumed up as it is messy, but the trigger release is very easy and you don't get your hands dirty cleaning it out. The DC 33 does seem heavier than the Oreck but the suction is so much better and the brushes seem to really get my carpets clean so much better that I don't mind. It doesn't like fringe on carpets because it is so powerful so I have to be careful there. As for the noise level, it is on par with the Oreck. Overall, I would buy it again."

Cleans very well.Bad:Awful Grinding Noise -First off is the terrible loud grinding noise you get every time you use this. It has so much power sometimes it thinks it caught on something and the beater bar is stopped as a security feature. You can remove two strips of rubber in the head to allow more air flow, but the terrible awful grinding noise still happens. It will honestly make you jump every time it happens it is so startling.Bulky and Awkward -This thing is hard to use. It's heavy to push around and hard to get close to edges.

I have left it stretched out for days, and even heated it up, and it still is super, super stiff.

I read all the do's and don't with this vacuum. I did this mainly because my mother purchased a Dyson Animal years ago and within a year it was VERY noisy and required endless parts replacements. I started out very careful because my mother is very hard on her appliances and doesn't always make the best decisions on use and maintenance of them. So I decided I was going to 'show her' that these things are great.We purchased the Dyson DC33 and immediately loved it. it pulled hair and dust from our new rental house even after it had already been professionally steam cleaned. needless to stay we were impressed! We purchased the Dyson Zorb and I was even more impressed by how much it helped pick up even more carpet debris. I decided to Zorb our entire house and that way we could start from a clean slate when we moved in. Well after completing about half of the house I noticed that the noise level started to get worse. So i stopped it and examined the brush heads to make sure I didn't get anything jammed in it and it looked clear I also checked to make sure the hard floor/carpet dial was not in between gears and it was firmly on the carpet setting. Upon turing the vacuum back on I happened to see the gear knob turn PAST the carpet setting and stop way out of the range of either setting. I turned off the unit and then the dial switched back into the carpet setting when i put the unit upright. I then turned it on again in the upright position then pushed the head down to engage the brushes and again the gear shifted past the carpet setting and began to make a horrible sound. I know what most people are thinking... I didn't read the directions and turned the dial when engine was engaged and I stripped the gears but after carefully reading the instructions I made sure NOT to do this. So now I have a 6 day old dyson that makes the same sounds my moms did after 6 months of use!!! After reading some of the other reviews it seems others have been experiencing this same issue when the pile on the carpet is too high and it slows the rotating brush bar until it strips the gears in the variable floor selector. My carpet is MAYBE medium pile carpet and thats being generous...but that being the case there IS NO WARNING about any kind of pile restrictions with this Dyson. I am very careful and I HATE consumers that get mad when their appliance breaks after they use it improperly but there was no warning and I'm not even sure a vacuum should be advertised as variable floor if it can't handle anything over short pile carpet!"

I LOVE not having to stop and unplug it to go into another room!  Granted, I cannot vacuum my entire house from one outlet, but I can get all the main parts that have the high traffic (mainly where the dogs go), so that's all that matters when I am just doing a quick vacuum job.  We do not have any carpet in our house...it is all wood, laminate and tile, so I was a bit concerned that it might not work as well, but it works wonderfully.  I highly recommend the Dyson DC33."

I LOVE the first one I got which was NOT the 'ball' version. When my first 'original' Dyson Konked out, my husband (who thinks anything more expensive is better) purchased me the purple ball style. I have hated it from day one! I HATE that the cord is so much shorter! It barely makes it through one room. I HATE the ball. This machine actually sort of broke a couple years ago but I sort of fixed it and put up with it as it was off warranty. Today, it finally died and I gladly went to Target to find my old best friend, the origanal yellow Dyson with NO ball! It was out of stock which I am seeing online that it is most places but I just found it here. So it looks like there are not enough people complaining about the cord and the stupid ball and the ridiculous increase in cost when you go up to the purple (just because it claims to pick up more animal hair). They all have awesome suction so I know they ALL get that pet hair! Anyway, today I am getting one of the last yellow original Dysons at Amazon!

Everyone was saying how heavy it was, and how its bulky and doesn't fit anywhere.... I will tell you that's all crazy! Its an amazing machine, it isn't hard to push, with the amount of suction it has I like going slow so it picks up everything. And you are vacuuming, so that means a little moving around furniture, so no it doesn't fit under everything, but just move it...or use the hose bc the power behind that is unbelievable too! I have a dog that sheds a lot, so I was thinking about the animal dyson, but you can just get the attachments for this one (bc it has the same motor and suction) for like $60 and I saved almost $250.

The super long cord is great, I don't have to stop and plug in somewhere else, just to vacuum the front rooms. If only the cord were retractable, it would be perfection. It is true that learning to use the on-board tools is a bit awkward, things don't necessarily work the way you think they should. But once you get the hang of it, it all works very fluidly. I never gave much thought to the lines left behind by a vacuum. Until I had them. Now I take great pleasure in the neat rows. Let's face it, if you're spending Dy$on money, you have some neatness issues and they have caught on to that. I've always had 2 vacs, a cordless for the kitchen and mud room and another for carpets.

I read the positive reviews along with the negative ones and figured I would make my own assumptions once I got my own Dyson and turns out it works amazingly! Now, if anyone has ever operated an upright vacuum they have experienced the vacuum tipping a little bit when using the attachments and I expected that with the Dyson since it happens with uprights but because the attachment reaches so far I haven't had that problem yet. And oh well if it does tip, I'll just pick it up again. The other complaint that I came across was that the front profile of the vacuum was so big that it didn't fit under any furniture or under cabinets, and as before, with my previous experience with uprights that has always seemed to be a problem. So I've adapted to that problem and just use the attachments to reach under those tight spaces. It works all the same.  I have no problems with these features. Now, the suction power on the Dyson is fantastic! I couldn't believe what came out of my freshly vacuumed carpet. My dad wasn't sold on the Dyson so I made him vacuum a section of carpet with his Oreck and then I went over it with my Dyson. The Dyson picked up so much fine hair, dust, and presumably skin that he had me vacuum the rest of his living room.  I can say for a fact that it gets the deep down stuff that other vacuums can't reach. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase especially since I got such a wonderful deal on it AND because it works ups to it's full potential. So anyone checking reviews ignore that negative ones since they seem to be petty complaints anyways. I love my Dyson."

When I clean bare floors I've noticed it blows hair around.  Today I tried to use the hose and it was too big and clumsy.  When I empty the canister I have to dig inside it to remove the pet hair, getting my hands dirty.  The instructions to the machine are lame.

The last Bissel lasted less than a year. The hose will take a while to loosen up, but I think that is a good thing as it will last and retain its shape longer. The only complaint I have is that we had no idea it would not handle certain tight weave area rugs. Bare floor setting doesn't pick up well, and the carpet setting produces a loud grinding sound that goes right through you. We have come to learn that this is an 'alarm' of sorts to let you know there is no suction. It is nothing short of annoying, and by rights should be if it is an 'alarm'.  However, what makes it more annoying is that a vacuum cleaner of this price and quality did not come with any warnings, special attachment for these types of rugs or the most logical solution - an intermediate setting for carpets and rugs. The mini-turbine is not an acceptable solution as it is too small to do a large area rug (a hand-tool meant for furniture). The Flat-Out tool *might* work, but I'm hesitant to spend $50 to find out.Dyson missed the mark on this one point. Hardwood and tile floors are, and have been for some time now, more popular than wall-to-wall carpet. With these types of flooring, area rugs are also common. Our house and lifestyle could not justify the cost of the more expensive models, however if we had seen one review of the many we read which warned of this short-coming we may have considered moving up. Short of selling the DC33 at a loss and purchasing a more expensive model, we are stuck with this since Dyson doesn't acknowledge it or provide an acceptable attachment solution. The DC33 is perfect in every other way and delivers on all of its advertised features *except* when it comes to tight weave area rugs. For this reason alone we could not give it a 5-star rating."

I decided to go for Dyson for their no loss of suction technology. I zeroed in on DC25 and DC33. I had a tough time researching them online to decide which one to buy. So I had to try them both before deciding. Here are the more subtle differences of DC33 over DC25 that really matters.1.) DC33 has a bigger canister compared to DC 25. You can continue vacuuming DC33 for longer before emptying the bin.2.) DC33 has a longer power cord. Actually I found it to be too long and a slight inconvenience strangely.3.) DC33 has more suction power than DC25 although only slight.4.) DC33 dust bar is fixed unlike DC25 which can be removed for cleaning. But the real advantage for DC25 is that the dust bar protrudes a good 6 - 8 inches away from the body of the Vacuum cleaner. This makes cleaning under the furniture with low ground clearance easier.5.) Maneuverability in DC33 is a slight inconvenience over DC25 because of the lack of BALL. Not many will consider this as a real disadvantage though.6.) The brush beater ON/OFF switch is located at the bottom in DC33 compared to DC25 where it is located near the power switch.7.) DC33 is inexpensive compared to DC25 at least on Dyson website. With Amazon deals I was able to grab a DC33 for $299 where as the DC25 was listed at $319. The prices keep changing but this was the best I could get.I eventually decided to go with DC33 because of the following factors. More suction, Bigger bin and cheaper than DC25."

"86","XX","B0043EW354","5.0","March 18, 2012","A1QIZNHS8DY3ZF","I LOVE this vacuum","First let me say, that I am lazy and hate to clean my house.  I have a 2500 square foot one level house, along with a parrot and two short haired dogs, so I am required to vacuum at least once a week.  I also have a Hoover Wind-Tunnel self propelled bagless vacuum which I've had for years and have really liked.  I was sort of nervous to spend this kind of money on a vacuum when the Hoover still works, but I know my Hoover can't last forever.  I will compare the two of the vacuums for you:  First I like the Dyson better because it is much much lighter and smaller.  I hate to drag out the Hoover from the closet and it's too big to stash in a corner, like I do the Dyson.  Both do a good job at picking up an unbelievable amount of dirt..where does all that dirt come from every week?!!?  I use the Dyson much more because it is handy to grab and use, rather than dragging out the Hoover.  Although the Hoover is self propelled, the Dyson is much lighter so I don't miss the self propelled feature.  The Dyson is also much quieter.  Both probably pick up about the same amount of dirt.  Like another reviewer says, the Dyson will suck a area rug right off the floor.  My Hoover never did that, but I learned that if you keep the handle at a lower angle to the floor, then for whatever reason it won't pull the rug (or not so tight carpet) up, causing an unworldly racket.  I like how the Dyson is easy to switch to hard floors, I have Laminate Flooring in a few rooms at my house.  Both the Dyson and the Hoover don't really get under counters because the front is too big, but both do an equal job of cleaning up dust on those.  The Hoover makes a lot of noise on hard floors and the Dyson doesn't. I don't know about the 'ball' Dyson or how that would have worked, but I'm happy with this one, it goes around corners just fine, because it's smaller.  As for the onboard tools, the 'telescoping' hose and tools is kind of cumbersome because the hose is kind of acordian like, and it tends to pull back into its original shape before you're ready.  I like the dust bin on the Dyson a lot better than the Hoover.  All you have to do is push a button and the bottom drops out, so you can put the whole thing into an empty garbage can, push the button and dust doesn't get all over, it just drops into the trash can.  With the Hoover, it's kind of a pain to take the top off, the filter out, etc.  The cord is plenty long, I wish it was self re-winding but my Hoover isn't either.  It doesn't stir up dust, and easily picks up dog hair, bird feathers and seeds, dust and dirt very well.  With the Hoover, it does lose suction after a few minutes but the Dyson really doesn't, which is a benefit if you hate to stop and empty the bin a million times,  I highly recommend it.  It was simple to put together and seems pretty sturdy, I would deffinately buy it over a Hoover, the only con being that the price is a little steep, but I think it's worth it. Hopefully it will last as long as my old faithful Hoover."

That one would shoot sand/kitty litter/small rocks back at your feet and legs when you tried to vacuum a low pile carpet, and instead of sucking the fine dirt out of the medium pile, it would simply vibrate it down into and through the rug where it would collect on the floor underneath.We finally bought a Dyson, and it actually sucks things up.  This is exciting.  It pulled all kinds of things out of the medium pile rug that the old vacuum couldn't be bothered with, and picked up the sand off the carpet by the kids' shoe basket instead of flinging it across the room and under the couch.  There is a great attachment that I used to vacuum animal hair and small crumbs off of furniture, the dust off of the fabric on the front of the speakers, the keys of the piano, I went crazy.I did notice that while cleaning the low pile area rug, I have to set it to bare floor, lest the carpet and vacuum start vibrating together and make a terrible noise.  But even with the brushes up, it is still cleaning the rug.  I can even see it being lifted up by the Dyson as I pull the vacuum backwards.Also, I am not in love with the wand thing.  It is a little hard to deal with.  It is awkwardly placed, very long, and kind of hard to use.  Maybe I'll feel differently when I do the ceiling fans, we'll see.Mine is a refurbished one.

Loved what I paid for it on Amazon compared to what the stores charge and even compared to what Dyson's site charges.  All in all, I understand now how people fall in love with inanimate objects.

As it turns out, all of the great things I heard were true.  It was amazing (and horrifying really) to see what came out of my carpet and how clean it could be.  I was skeptical on the bare floor cleaning but again, was so pleased at how well the Dyson did on our wood and linoleum floors.  While the bulky head of the vacuum doesn't fit in all the small spaces, I found our dog hair tumbleweeds left their crevice perches and actually were sucked toward the Dyson just by vacuuming nearby.  All and all, complete vacuum happiness.  I highly recommend it."

It works fine on hardwoods, but on area rugs and certain kinds of carpets, it doesn't work. It actually makes a terrible screeching noise. Dyson has a 'fix' which is removing a belt, but it continued to make the noise even after. It doesn't work well on rugs when not on the carpet setting.

This vac has great suction, emptying the cannister is easy, the cord is nice and long, it' light weight, and the onboard storage of the attachment tools is convenient,  but that is where it ends.  The profile is very high, so unless you have furniture on stilts or say a high profile coffee table or kitchen table with a minimum of 1 foot clearance good luck cleaning under it. You will have to move furniture or use the attachment and wrestle the wand.  My LG and an older Hoover both got pretty far under a bed and no problem going under a coffee table that was 6 inches off the floor. This vac can be used on hard floors but it can't even get near the 3 inches of over hang under my kitchen cabinets. So it's basically worthless in my kitchen. My biggest complaint is the attachment feature and it's because of this that I regret buying this vac. The high profile of the vac pretty much ensures you will need to use the attachments.  The wand when extended is extremely unweildy. Nothing swivels so you have to do everything at right angles or parallell which is often a chore or and sometimes not possible unless you move funiture. When the wand isn't extended you have to stoop way over to use it and again you can't adjust how the attachment sits into the wand or twist it to a different direction once it's in. This is a big pain when trying to vacum up against baseboards or around the edge of furniture, especially in a semi tight space of say less than 3 ft x 3 ft. like behind a bathroom door with a countertop nearby.  When vacuuming a lamp shade or stairs I felt as though I was wrestling an animal. The suction is so powerful that you are struggling against the force of the suction to control what you are doing.  It was a work out on my back to vacum my carpeted stairs. I wouldn' dream of trying to use it on curtains, I accidentally got near some and it sucked them in the wand at least 6 inches.  LG had controls for power and movement from carpet to floor right at your finger tips on the handle. The attachment wand was much shorter (but extendable) and the flexible hose off the attachment wand was much longer allowing for much more flexibility in movement. The on/off switch on the Dyson vac is further down. You have to bend over and move a knob to switch from floor to carpet.  Lastly, the quick start directions that came with this vac was missing key information such as how to move the vac into position to vacum.  I finally figured it out, you step on the base of the vacum as you push the handle back, again, it's an awkward design. I happened to mention I purchased this vac to a friend who has the same exact vac.  She underscored the same complaints. I wish I had tried this vac out before purchasing it. Now I am stuck with it unless I want to pay shipping to return it.  For a vacum that touts it's superior suction engineering it utterly fails in the area of engineering and design of the attachment feature and access under furniture."

After doing some research I decided to buy the DC33 over the super expensive DC41. I was so excited when I got home and did the vacuum test. I vacuumed with our old Dyson and then with the new and was disgusted and surprised with how much dirt the DC33 still picked up! I thought I was sold on the vacuum, but when I went to use the wand I was disappointed. The hose will not pick up anything unless you have an attachment on it (which I hate) and even then it barely picked up anything at all. I am reading some of these reviews that say it sucks in your shirt, but seriously I think I could have fed it my shirt and it would have spat it out! I decided to buy the Shark and I am thrilled with it! I did the same vaccum test with the DC33 and the Shark. The Shark still had more to pick up. It also has a shorter head so that it fits below some furniture. We returned the Dyson within our thirty days and I am not at all sorry. Overall, I don't know if it's just the DC33 or all new Dysons, but comparing it to my old Dyson (think it was the DC13), it seems that Dyson has gone for a cheaper, less reliable (though more expensive) product.

I did not expect to be overly impressed with a vacuum cleaner.  this one  cleans well and seems to have plenty of suction power over time where other vacuums that I have owned in the past seem to have their suction diminish over time (probably due to filters starting to clog).  One thing in particular that I noticed is that there is no smell of dust in the air after vacuuming the floors.  Also, the unit is well-engineered having several ports with latches to make clearing any clog easy, although we just recently got our first clog after vacuuming up loose long needles from our Christmas tree.  I examined the two filters (one or both are HEPA?) and there was no evidence of anything at all accumulating on them even after almost a full year of regular use.  Our previous upright always ended up with dust caked up on the filters that required cleaning, washing, and drying.  I like the fact that the spinning brush can be turned off by just pressing a button to clean hard-surfaced floors.  I can only find a couple of minor things to criticize about the design.  The hose wand stores in the top of the handle and when removed for use the straight non-flexible section at the end seems a little long and awkward.  Also, there is no buit-in light to illuminate the floor ahead of the vacuum while cleaning."

One thing it tells me is that my old DC14 is still working great after all these years.  I think my old DC14 has more suction.  The new DC33 moves across the carpet with more ease, however...is smoother.  It could be due to the newer, stiffer bristles on the roller.  I actually bought a new brush roller for my DC14, but I haven't received it yet...will be curious as to how it moves after installation.It's pretty much the same vacuum as my old one, except for the placement and design/size of the tools and the new plastic handle extension (which I don't like...the metal one on my DC14 is much sturdier and I prefer it..this one bends & feels flimsy), and placement of filter.  And I like my old brush tool much better, with the articulating head that moved as the angle of my vacuuming changed.  The new one is smaller, static and feels cheap. The tools definitely are less prone to falling off the new one, however, since they're not located on top of the canister as on the old one.  All in all, I got what I expected...a new Dyson that acts exactly as I'd expect it too.

I've been looking for a good vacuum for wood floors that has great suction since I live in a 200 yr old home with its original floors, which means the planks have slight separations and I need to get the dirt and dust between them. This vacuum does that. So well in fact, that I thought I might suck up 200 yr old nails holding the boards in. After the first run, I just felt cleaner. I have a few rugs that don't get dirt on them but get small leaves or lint/dust on them. The vacuum doesn't get that clean if I leave it on the bare floor setting, but it does a fantastic job if I move it to the carpet setting. Some reviews say it's difficult to switch settings while on the go but I have no problem switching it back and forth with my foot. The wheels glide easy and I haven't seen any marks on the floor. But granted my floors are super old and so I might just be missing the marks if there were any. The power cord is so long! It's great. I can clean entire levels without having to switch the cord around. This is fantastic when I have 3 levels to vacuum. It's easy to put together and easy to empty the dirt pan.The cons. Again, I live in an old house that is in farm land, which means I get spiders inside with their webs. So I have to dust floor boards and corners a lot. I wanted something that I could easily attach a dust attachment and get it all done while I'm doing the floors. This vacuum does that but it is the most awkward thing I have ever used. The hose is so stiff that it will not stretch if the vacuum base isn't held in place, it will just roll along with you nipping at your heels. Then there is this long plastic extension tube that runs inside the hose which doesn't let it bend if you don't extend it. So you extend it and then suddenly you need to be 5 ft away from whatever you are cleaning. And just forget tight corners, you can't get to them without disassembling the hose. So you can get it clean, but it won't be a speedy task. There is also a picture of a person stretching that hose a full flight of stairs, mine will not stretch that far leaving me 3 steps short. I don't mind this, but it's a bit misleading. Then there is the heft of it. The vacuum itself is sturdy but not too heavy for me to carry up stairs easily. But stretching that hose is like an olympic weight lifting match. Maybe it's because I need to do more push ups but it is difficult to keep extended when I'm on the stairs. It's a workout and I don't mind it but it's defiantly not a plus. And lastly, you will never fit this vacuum under any furniture other than a table. Don't even try. It won't happen. Get the flat attachment and go that way.In all, it's a great vacuum and works well, I would just like the attachment hose to be more user friendly and not so difficult to maneuver."

When I first got the machine, I was very impressed with its suction, even for pet hair.  I felt like my carpets were really getting clean.  However, the reason I traded in my Hoover was the suction was no longer there and I was willing to pay more for a vacuum that would have the ability to outlast my Hoover.  Unfortunately, although the Dyson's have no 'vacuum' that lose efficiency over time they have other issues.  The first time it needed service, the lever that holds the canister to the vacuum malfunctioned and had to be repaired ($90), but this problem could have been an idiosyncrasy of my vacuum.  Recently, I noticed it was just not cleaning up my carpets and that the suction both from the wand and the unit was just not there. I took it back to the repair shop where they did a basic 'tune up and cleaning' for $100.  I soon got a call from the shop and was told it would need a clutch soon; I declined to have that repair done as it would have been another $65-$75.  While I was there, I noticed all the vacuums in line for repair were--Dysons.  The clerk confirmed that this was normal, basically Dyson is keeping her boss in business.  Although, I understand that since the price of the Dyson is so much higher, people are much more likely to get them repaired.  Still, the machine was sold on the idea it would not lose suction because it does not have a vacuum, this idea is patently untrue, they clearly lose suction over time!  All being said, after my repair my vacuum is working better than it did before but not nearly as good as it did when I first got it.  I would not buy another one; for the price of my Dyson, I could have purchased several new vacuums over the years to get consistently better results.Pros:-Initial suction and cleaning are good-No messy bags-Easy to empty canister-Filter is easy to clean (must be done 1x/month)Cons:-Expensive-Exposure to dirt and dust when dumped in trash (canister dumps directly into trash can - not good for those with allergies!)-Long-term cleaning is less than desirable, losing suction gradually over time-Although the filter is easy to clean, you must do it when you know you will not be using Dyson for 24 hours as filter must dry completely."

I was immediately connected with a very friendly and competent representative who explained that the machine's suction power was too strong for the height of my carpet. She gave me some very simple instructions for removing a piece from the bottom of the vacuum and within 5 minutes, the vacuum was up and running as advertised.While this defect was initially annoying, it was very easy to fix.

First vacuum that came out of the box made horrible noises when you bumped something.  Called Dyson and they didn't have a solution, so they told us to take it back.  Got another one that worked without making the horrible noise.  But, even though to generally vacuum the house it is fine, I do not like the hose or attachments.  I use my attachments more than I use the standard vacuum in my house and I found it a pain to use.  The flimsy plastic handle is no match for the heavy duty coils.  I found that it puts a lot of pressure on my wrist.  I also didn't find it very easy to use.  You have to put the extension up and it makes it just to clumsy to clean under the table or in tighter spaces.  I would also love to see an auto-rewind on this considering the cord is so long.

The bad reviews made me think; if anything it's going to be heavy, not pick up strings and not reach under furniture. NONE of that was the case.  Putting it together was a snap.  Then I started to test it out.Test 1)  I had no problems putting my foot on the base to tilt the handle back.  Not having a release isn't a big deal.Test 2)  Pushing is across my plush carpet wasn't hard at all.  It felt the same as any other vacuum I've used.  It makes me wonder if other reviewers had shag carpet.Test 3)  IT PICKED UP THE STRING!  I threw a black string on the floor (regular thread for sewing) and ran the vacuum over it once and saw it was gone. A huge Grinch still smile was on my face.  The excitement started to brew now.Test 4)  It didn't reach under my sofa but I popped off one of the attachments and the hose and reached under there with no problem.

It even made the carpet look better too.  I had a hard time figuring out how to get the hose out and then putting it back together, but I finally got it done.

Assembled it with no issues, it literally snaps together in a couple minutes.  Stated vacuuming, but was shocked when it kept making a HORRIBLE noise, like a sock was sucked up.  Finally called Dyson and the very nice lady in customer service informed me that the DC33 is NOT meant for area rugs, even if they are secured to the floor.  What?!  Apparently, the 'clutch contolled brush' models are only meant for hard floors or wall to wall carpet that is tacked down.  The brush is powered by suction and, although it doesn't seem like the rug is being sucked up in the vacuum, it is.  She said that my options were to vacuum my rugs with the brush turned off (really???) or to choose a model that has a belt driven brush (which most are).Now, having said all this and feeling incredible disappointment, I did go ahead and vacuum one rug without the brush on and it did pick up tons of dirt and dog hair that my other vacuum left behind and that did surprise me.  I think this would be a great vacuum for those with wall to wall carpet.  However I am returning it and already purchased a DC41, which I am totally smitten with!"

I'm writing this as the DC33 didn't have a lot of reviews for my type of usage.  I also wanted to state that I had a grinding noise that wasn't referenced a lot in the Amazon reviews but was prevalent when I searched for this issue.First, I am thoroughly enjoying my DC33.  It's exactly what I needed for my house that has mostly solid surface flooring.  Living in California, we attract dust balls and no matter how often you clean, you will find dust balls throughout your house.  Also, I don't have pets but a wife with very long hair that somehow seems to find its way on the floors of our house.  Lastly, the DC33 replaced an Electrolux battery powered vacuum stick that worked well for over three years but did lose suction power that we hardly ever used it.The DC33 has picked up a lot of dust even though we cannot see the dust.  It's easy to use and I personally don't mind having to plug it in so that I get the most suction power possible.  I agree that the one issue is the attachments but could not understand what people were writing about in their reviews.  Let me try and see if I can explain it.  The attachment tool is a bit clumsy as when you use it, it pulls the vacuum with it.  Picture trying to vacuum your couch and when you stretch the tool, you feel the vacuum come with it.  Not sure how I'd fix it but just wanted people to understand the issue.  The good news is that I used the DC33 to vacuum my couch and it worked like a charm.  I didn't even think about this as an option when purchasing the DC33 so I'm pleasantly surprised.So far, I've used the DC33 about six times and can't complain except for one issue:  the grinding noise.  When I first turned it on and was vacuuming an area rug, the DC33 let out a loud grinding noise; I thought I broke it.  I kept vacuuming and the noise would occasionally occur but only when I was vacuuming the area rugs.  I found out that for low-ply carpeting, the suction power is too strong and is actually sucking up the rug causing the noise.  I called customer service and by taking out a rubber strip from the beater bar (bottom of the vacuum for those like me that didn't know what this was) and the noise has mostly gone away.  I have had the noise once or twice but I also know it's not destroying the DC33 so I'm OK.Overall, I gave it a four star rating due to the clumsy attachment situation.  Don't get me wrong, the attachments are so much better than my older vacuums as the suction power is very strong, it's just clumsy."

"148","XX","B0043EW354","5.0","December 28, 2011","A2ZR2YL36D7IQZ","One Year Later and I Still Love It","I purposely waited to write this review.  I've bought several vacuums and noticed that I always LOVE them the first few uses but ultimately they always end up a disappointment.  I'm very pleased to report that the Dyson DC33 bucked the system and is still as good one year later as it was the day I took it out of the box!I agonized over this purchase, reading every review, searching the holiday sales and even wondering which Dyson model to get (if you're reading this then I'm sure you're doing the same thing!).  I can honestly say that I don't have any regrets about this decision.  So, here are my favorite things about this Dyson and some other observations after a lot of use.First the setting:  Split level home with 75% carpet a very light off-white color, as well as some hardwood floors, tile and area rugs.  I actually bought this vacuum the day after new carpet was put in.  We also have a large dog.  She's short-haired but she definitely sheds daily (she's a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog). No kids.Why I like it:Excellent at removing dog hair, even from the very short-pile area rugs that can be tough to remove fine dog hair from.  I find that I need to make sure I make a slow pass over the rug, but as long as I don't do a quick back and forth, then all the debris and hair is picked up.Easy to move and easy to carry.  If I recall, it's weight is on par with other vacuums, however the shape and style of this one seems to make it easier to carry around the house.  It also moves smoothly and easily across all surfaces.Easy to empty.  This is my third bagless style vacuum and this one is by far the easiest and cleanest to empty. In the rooms that are off limits to our dog I can easily vacuum a few times and not empty the canister.  In the rooms with dog hair, I definitely need to empty after each room.  (so at least I know it's really working!)Hose and On-board attachments:  From what I remember of the reviews, this gets mixed reviews.  It's true that the stiffness of the hose and the angle of the handle can be a little cumbersome.  It's something you adjust to.  But despite what it looks like or how it feels, I can definitively say that the hose and attachments work well and have no problems picking up debris.  It seems like the bent angle of the hose would prevent suction or pick-up, but it doesn't.  I prefer using the hose and attachments on the stairs rather than holding up the vacuum because the coverage is better (and don't forget that the main vacuum doesn't have suction if the arm is upright, that engages the hose instead so that's part of the issue with getting the right angle on the stairs)One trick that's helped me with the hose is to stretch it out and then hold part of it to keep it extended.  To me making the adjustment is well worth it to have the vacuum be more compact and everything in one place.Still working one year later.  I know I'm harping on that point, but since they sell this based on 'won't lose suction' I have to vouch for the fact that it's true!  This vacuum is used multiple times a week in a dry climate with dust, dog hair, etc.  The maintenance on the filters is easy and only has to be done every few months.  And the design seems to really make a difference.One other observation:I remember reading comments about the design, the 'flimsy' or 'cheap' plastic materials, etc. And when I took this out of the box, I had some of the same concerns.  But I reminded myself that this whole thing was engineered by a guy known to be a bit of a perfectionist.  I've known a few engineers myself -- they rarely do something without a plan or reason and they really don't like to be wrong.  So, I took a leap of faith and decided to defer judgment until I had used the vacuum awhile.  After using, maintaining, cleaning and carrying this vacuum, I can see the 'why' in a lot of the pieces and design.  So when you wonder how that little plastic lever can really hold the full weight of the vacuum when you carry it - trust me, it just does.  Or when you wonder why there's a button that opens the vacuum tube into the canister rather than a solid piece, they had a reason (it's so you can open it up and get an object like say a pen that you accidentally sucked up with the wand!)After years of having vacuums that didn't work well and left you wondering why you even bothered, it's nice to own one that leaves you with a sense of accomplishment every time you use it."

I had just vacuumed with our old vacuum and went over it again with the Dyson.  It picked up so much missed dirt.  The suction pulled up the wall to wall carpet.  We have four pets (and a puppy that visits often) so we have to vacuum regularly.  This picks up dirt off hardwood floors and deep down dirt in carpet.  It does really well on pet fur as well.  It's really easy to remove the wand and get into crevasses.  One in awhile the base of the vacuum will fall over when using the wand, but not an inconvenience for me.  The tank fills up fast and I have to empty it often.  Wish the capacity was a little bigger.  I would recommend the Dyson DC33 to anyone.  It's well worth the money."

My house has never been cleaner!  My husband and I fight to see who gets to vacuum.  My carpets and floors have never looked better.  I am shocked that people actually rated it 1 and 2 stars.  I honestly do not believe the people that say it didn't clean their carpet.  Maybe they had a defective vacuum but I promise, ours is amazing.  We have a dog so I vacuum about 3x per week.  Even with my vacuuming routinely the Dyson still finds a ridiculous amount of dirt to pick up every time.  I read some person was upset that they had to wrap up the cord....what they didn't mention is that the cord is extra long.  Once you plug it in, you don't have to keep changing the outlet.  It is a little big in the front and will not fit under your cabinets in the kitchen/bathroom/etc.  However, the attachments are very easy to use and it really isn't that bad to have to use the attachment -it is better than having to use two vacuums (carpet/hardwood).  I can literally see the dirt/hair being sucked into the vacuum as I turn it on, I am not sure why people say that it doesn't pick up dirt.  If the cup gets full it will stop picking up, but once you dump it goes back sucking up everything!  I actually carry a plastic bag with me as a vacuum and keep dumping the cup.  It makes for a quicker vacuuming session when you don't have to keep walking back to the trash can.  The best part is I can vacuum my stairs so easily!  The vacuum stays on the bottom floor and the attachment can reach all the way up an entire flight of stairs.  I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cup is kind of small and if you are going to vacuum, you will need to dump at least 2-3 times.This vacuum has made my house so much cleaner and less dusty!

I didn't give it a 5 out of 5 because I find the hose a little annoying to work with.  It's very tight, which makes it coil up effortlessly when I'm done vacuuming, but during use I usually have to wrestle with it a little.Things I've used my dyson for that worked well:Plush carpet, burber carpet, outdoor/cheapy carpet, hardwood, tile, concrete, baseboards, blinds, window sills, car, spider webs, stink bugs, and cat litter.Oh and it doesn't have a smell when I run it.  For example, with my old vacuum after christmas it would smell like pine needles forever, or less nostalgic: like dog because I have dogs.

I repeat...The vacuum does not work on rugs. It makes an extremely loud grinding sound as stated by other readers that will wake your neighbors. I called Dyson to ask for solutions and their fix is to remove a seal from the underside of the vacuum that lessens the suction. I can now vacuum rugs with the ear deafening clacking sound present only 50% of the time. My sacrifice for this non-solution? Just some of the famous Dyson suction that draws consumers to this vacuum in the first place.No one should complain about the suction power of this vacuum. It is extremely impressive. Where Dyson went wrong was that they took their ground breaking suction technology and didn't bother to make it practical for use in a vacuum. Picture scientists patting each other on the back with stogies in their hands congratulating each other and deciding to make a vacuum out of their discovery on a drunken dare. That's what you have here. The vacuum creates so much suction that it isn't able to pick up anything larger than a grain of rice because it is suctioned to the ground so completely. The impressive suction power also keeps the attachment hose from fully extending so you are constantly attacked by the rolling canister as you attempt to vacuum up said grains of rice. This vacuum is not useful for house cleaning by any means.My biggest regret is giving away our 10 year old vacuum to my friend before trying out the Dyson. I have toyed with the idea of trading the Dyson back for my old vacuum. I ultimately decided that I liked my friend too much and it would be too cruel an act.PS. Do plan on spending well over $100 extra dollars on attachments if you do have rugs. Cue laughing and drunken scientists."

Brought it home unpacked it and found that putting it together is slightly tricky as the wand stuff is really a part of the upright handle.  Snapping it into place took me a few minutes to figure out how to do it.Now the cool part, the carpet had just been vacuumed the night before.  Was a bit surprized to see the amount of Dog Hair it picked up.  In fact real surprised.  Had to empty container three times.  So I would say it passed the muster for Picking up dog hair (that wasn't visible until it was in container).Additionally, it picked up a lot of really fine dust particles.  I'm not sure but I don't know if beater bar is really fast or powerful as the main selling point is the suction.  It does a very good job of that.  As others have stated the extra long wand handle stored in the upright handle of the cleaner is a bit clumsy but nice for ceilings.Also, It is the quietest vacuum I've heard.  Nice...Read the manual, turns out that the motor turns 98,000RPM.  Yes that's the claim.  It's electronically controlled via a chip.  So the motor itself is new technology and 'is 5 times faster than any other conventional vacuum motor'.  The cyclonic action was 'borrowed' from industrial funnel type dust collectors from a wood shop.  Still can't figure out how the dust isn't sprayed across the room, as it just sits in the bottom of the clear container with NO FILTER.  That part is a stumper to me.I believe the new motor design is why it's much quiter... This summer I saw a Dyson fan at Best Buy.  No viewable turning fan blades but tons of air.  It has to be using the same motor design.  Totally cool."

Lots of reasons why (read my review) but suffice to say it just didn't met our needs; so I bought the DC33.First the downside.  If you have a deep pile carpet-this is NOT the machine for you.  As an average guy (yes ladies I do the vacuuming) I was surprised how difficult this is to push on deep pile.  This isn't some 2' 70's shag, but it actually makes cleaning this room a chore.As you may read on a lot of sites-with the angle of the head you won't be cleaning under many pieces of furniture.Third, as the owner of 4 dogs, 5 cats and an African Gray Parrot-I not only need to keep a clean house but I know what picks up hair.  Don't be misled-if you have animals you will be sticking your fingers in the canister to clean it out.  Fur gets caught not only in the grate inside the canister but along this 'ring' around the bottom of where the grate ends.  Hard to clean-no....but you will be cleaning it.Some people complain this has too much power and sucks up area rugs.  I experienced the same thing (and the really loud noise) but when initially lowering the head to vacuum.  I found the key was tilt the cleaner back first, then lower the head.  The machine has enough power and the brushes engage fast enough my foot was sometimes on the head too long (like half a second) and the brushes catch.Don't be fooled.  The Dyson works well-but its not magic.  Areas where our cats leave the litter box obviously have a lot of litter in the carpet.  The Dyson does pick all of it up-but its not one pass...or two...or even four.  Granted, our old machine never seemed to get all of it.Now the good news.  Its cheaper than the 25, has a longer cord, more power and bigger canister.  The very first thing I noticed when I turned it on was how quiet it ran; you can hear the T.V or actually hold a conversation.The stair cleaning tool (the hose minus the wand) works REALLY well.  Honestly, our stairs have never looked better.Its light and doesn't seem to leave vacuum 'marks' on our carpet.Some people mention its pricey-we got our during a Kohls 30% off sale with Kohls's cash as a bonus so our net price was around $270.  Expensive for a vacuum but a 5 year warranty means Dyson stands behind the machine.Would I buy it again...yep"

Yesterday I was vacuuming with an old Kenmore lug around that has been with me for about 15 years and it finally gave up and stopped working.  So I went to a local retailer (because I had a coupon) and purchased the Dyson DC33 Multi-Floor Vacuum.This vacuum is amazing, and I will never purchase any other vacuum ever!  Oh, and just another pointer before I begin, this vacuum is one of the most powerful invented by Dyson as far as air wattage (suction) is concerned, it has a 240 air watt rating, most of the Dyson balls and Animal machines are in the 165 to 220 range.  So about the machine, it is built very well and extremely durable.  The suction power is CRAZY!!!  Some background about my apartment, we have two medium hair cats (a sokoke forest cat and a russian blue) and a dog (pit-bull terrier mix).  All three shed religiously, but the majority of the pet hair in the apartment comes from the dog.  There is carpet in the bedroom and wood floors in the living room, dinging room, kitchen, laundry room, and bathrooms.  I was able to vacuum my bedroom with the old vacuum before it died.  I wanted to do the 'Dyson Test' and vacuum my bedroom again and see what the old vacuum left behind.  I about gagged when I looked at the bin.  There was dust, cat hair, and carpet freshening powder (almost a full inch all the way around the bin).  My carpet in my bedroom has NO smell at all anymore, the air in the bedroom is noticeably cleaner, and the carpet is fluffy and spongey again.  The machine is incredibly easy to maneuver and here is one of the best features, you do NOT have to move cords laying around or by baseboards, the vacuum simply pushes them upward out of it's way to clean what is under them and then puts them back so to speak.  Awesome design!After the bedroom I cleaned the entire apartment with the vacuum and WOW!  This machine does incredibly well on hardwood floors as well!  It has my floors completely spotless which has never happened since moving in due to the pet hair.  There is no dog or cat hair anywhere, and again the air is noticeably cleaner and easier to breath.  OH, an important point for those with allergies or asthma, this vacuum is allergy and asthma certified, it does not indicate this on the Dyson website when using the search for your perfect vacuum feature, but it is says so on the machine and the box.Also for those of you who wear contact lenses...  I told my mother about his vacuum and she said they are nice but does not want to use one because she doesn't want dust in her contact lenses when she empties the bin.  Good news.. This vacuum does NOT make a cloud of dust so emptying is suitable for even the most sensitive of contact lense wearer's.  I wear glasses myself and have switched from contact lenses to glasses for eye health reasons.The attachments that come with the vacuum are a 'dusting' attachment and a 'hard to reach' attachment with bristles.  They are both very well built and work well, however I do think I will be purchasing the other tool sets as they offer more versatility.  About the hose/wand that so many people complain about...  It is a little difficult to use at first but does get better with some practice.  Many people complain saying it is impossible to use, that is most certainly NOT true it is usable but keep in mind that Dyson built the hose to retain DURABILITY so yes it is stiff but does loosen up after a coupe of uses and it most definitely reaches he ceilings.  I did notice a little neck and lower back discomfort from using the wand because I was using it to clean a vent on the ceiling but I think that is pretty much standard when cleaning something 9 feet above you with a hose...The wheels glide so easily on any surface and it is easy to change directions if you wish to do so, the cord is CRAZY long, could probably do the whole apartment without moving the cord.  The air that is expelled from the vacuum is clean, clean, clean!  NO ODOR AT ALL!  There are two HEPA filters that have a lifetime guarantee and have to be washed every three months minimum (ONLY cold water and NO cleaners, soaps, or scrubbing and wait 24 hours before using the vacuum after cleaning so the HEPA filter's may properly dry).As for mom's,  please stop lugging around that old vacuum that picks up 1/10 of the dirt on your floor, and puts out dirty air with who knows what in it.  You deserve much more than that, after all you are mom's!  You do so much work around the house, from cooking to cleaning to homework, etc, you don't have time to use an old vacuum that you have to vacuum the same spot over and over again.  Plus if you have children, especially babies and toddlers, you'll feel a lot better about letting them crawl on the carpet or floors once you know that they are actually clean.The vacuum is lightweight and easy to store, so those with mild arthritis or other discomfort should not have any problems using this wonderful machine.Oh, one last thing...  before using my Dyson vacuum my apartment took on the familiar but not so pleasant 'Oh you have pets, a dog and two cats.  Hmmm...'  even though I cleaned the house weekly, with one thorough vacuum the smells are gone, and I mean GONE!"

Sorry, I did not get from Amazon, but I want all to know that I do like the machine.  Suction is good on what littlecarpet I have.  I do have a problem with trying to dust with it.  Attachments fit into the hose and the hose just does not feel comfortable to use.  It will extend, but you have to hold it after extending or else it goes back to the tight hose again.  I don't like the fact that there are not wands to attach to the hose so you can attach the floor nozzelto it.  I have bare floors and this would really be a big help.  I use to use a Hoover Windtunnel with a long extra hose and wands.  The suction was not as good as the Dyson, but at least I could get under furniture and dust furniture.  I believe I will have to buy another cannister vac to do what I use to do with my Windtunnel.  Once we get carpet, theDyson will work for us much better, because of the great suction.  Right now, I am not really a happy camper."

It seems to really suck up the dirt from my carpets. My only real complaint is that you have to turn off the vacuum, switch it to another setting, then turn it back on to proceed vacuuming. Basically, you can't go from vacuuming your carpet to vacuuming your woods floors. It makes a horrible noise if you try to switch it before turning it off. Also, the hose extension for hard to reach places doesn't stretch that great. But it's not heavy and it gets the job done. I'm sure I'll get used to the 'switching on an off part' and maybe over time the hose will be easier to use."

For whatever reason, the vacuum made a horrible grating noise whenever we vacuumed that particular rug - and it got worse as time went by, to the point of being intolerable. We have three different types of rugs in our house, and only one caused this problem. We finally replaced it with the much-smaller Dyson Animal DC35 - which works for our 1430 square foot house which now has hardwood floors and area rugs (we pulled up all of our carpet since buying the DC33), and doesn't make that horrible noise.This is the first Dyson I've owned, and definitely the most expensive vacuum thus far. Taking that into account, I really like it so far! It's much larger than the Eureka I owned before, but surprisingly doesn't weigh any more. It might even weigh a little less! Most importantly, it works really well! Our rugs look nicer and feel softer after using this vacuum. I like the long cord, and I LOVE how easy it is to empty the canister - just hold it over the trash can and press a button! I HAVE experienced the horrible noise it makes if you run over the edge of a rug and it starts to suck it up, so that is one thing to be careful of! It's also very large, but worth the superior vacuuming.The wand has a LONG piece of plastic at the end that doesn't bend. This is good for vacuuming clear under couches and beds, but can make it a bit unwieldy."

We spent $99 on the Bissell, hated it, and decided to spend more in hopes of greater quality. Admittedly being a little smitten by Dyson's marketing, we thought the Dyson 33 would be the end-all/be-all of vacuums. It was easy to put together, is easy to maneuver, has exceptional cord reach, and the wand/hose extension make it very easy to access hard-to-reach places. However, I found the suction power to be meager at best. For the price of this vacuum, I expected far more.We have saltillo tile floors with a few low-pile area rugs, and it took multiple attempts to get this vacuum to pick up the smallest of particles (dust bunnies, flecks of lint, small dried leaves from the houseplant). The hose attachment (despite its length) is virtually worthless because the suction power is so poor. We had to swipe one area of dust bunnies in the corner about 5 times before it grabbed anything. We even stopped to check all the fittings, re-read directions and be sure we put this together properly. It just has really poor suction. Also, the front of the vacuum (around the beater brush) rides so close to the floor that it acts like a bulldozer pushing dust/dirt forward rather than actually sucking it in. I find that to be a huge design flaw.Perhaps this is a 'low-end' model for Dyson, but it is certainly a mismatch on price for the actual performance you receive."

I asked him to get me a Hoover Wind Tunnel because it is so much cheaper, even though I loved my old Dyson.  I have to say I do love this one, too.  It is similar to my old Dyson.  The features I love are how wonderfully it cleans and suctions, how the long wand extends, and how easy it is to empty the cannister.I have read other reviews about how carpet can get 'sucked up' into the machine and can make that awful grinding noise.  I have several oriental rugs and some wall to wall carpet.  I have experienced this, but only if I accidentally run the vacuum over the carpet fringe or over those small kick rugs (like my bathroom rug).  I have learned from my old Dyson to clean these with the attachments as the suction is just too powerful for them (which is great!)I have also read this vacuum is heavy.  It is lighter than my old Dyson so I don't feel like it is heavy at all!I don't have issues with the wand being so rigid - I find it useful for cleaning ceiling cob webs.  It is annoying if you are trying to use it clean out your car, so I use a shop vac for that.  (I know - not everyone has that option).Minor annoyances are:- High Profile - It can't reach under my kitchen counters due to it's high profile.  I'd prefer not to have to get out the wand just to do the baseboards.- Cord Wrap - I find it annoying to have to unravel entire cord every time I use the vacuum.- Beater Bar - Like my old Dyson, you have to cut the hair off the beater bar while it is turned upside down.  Seems like there should be an easier way.Major annoyance: - I do have issue with the rigid plastic pieces that hold this vacuum together.  My old Dyson's handle broke and could not be replaced.  I fear that the same thing or something similar will occur with this one.  The cost savings of not having to replace your bags does not occur if you have to buy a new vacuum every 5 years."

I have NOT been disappointed with my choice at all! I am still absolutely amazed every time I vacuum the house! I love the fact that it has a long cord. I do have to unplug it once and move it...but with a 1900 sq foot house that would be expected! I love how easy it is to empty...with just a push of a button it is emptied directly into the garbage (I do choose to empty it in the outside garbage can because of the dust). It switches from hard floor surfaces to carpet easy and works great on both surfaces! The pull out wand is easy to use and stretches from the bottom of the stairwell to the top step with no problems. I know some people have complained about the vacuum falling backwards when the hose is outstretched but I have not had that experience. I tend to vacuum the house 1-2 times a week, we do not eat outside the kitchen, do not wear our shoes in the house, and our dog is not the shedding breed of dog, so overall I think that we are a pretty clean family until I vacuum...absolutely amazing how much dirt is there!

It is built like a tank, and handles much like our other one (maybe a bit more bulky, and the telescoping wand takes a bit of getting used to). It functions great (I use baking soda/borax on our carpets and the vacuum picks it all up, all of the time). Can't do small floor carpets anymore (suction way too strong) but that is part of the appeal. When I need to vacuum something I will be close to (chair cushions, for example) I simply remove the whole wand and put an attachment directly on the hose.

Because it's starting to show its age after years of heavy use, I've been thinking about purchasing a new one for several months.  When Dyson announced a sale on selected uprights, I decided to go for it and purchased the DC33 at Target.  (I did not purchase at Amazon because 1) I wanted the vacuum immediately and 2) I figured it would be easier to return a vacuum to my nearby Target than send back to Amazon if I changed my mind.)  The vacuum assembled easily after getting it out of the box. (Be careful opening the box! My husband cut his finger following Dyson's 'how to open' instructions.)  My husband vacuumed the family room floor and I inspected the results.  The DC33 really didn't seem to be picking up much.  I have two cats, so when I vacuum I usually pick up a lot of cat hair.  My husband suggested that perhaps the floor wasn't that dirty?  I was sceptical.  So I got out my old DC17 and vacuumed over the same area the DC33 had just cleaned.  It was amazing how much dirt and cat hair the old vacuum picked up that the DC33 missed!  I don't know whether the old Dysons are more powerful than the new ones or whether the DC33 is just inferior to the DC17, but I decided the DC33 was not a keeper and returned it to Target the same day I purchased it.

It truly does clean the carpets well.  As for the attachments, they were o.k.  Our house has several carpeted steps that need a little more than the flat surfaced attachment, so we will probably purchase one of the course bristled attachments.  I was AMAZED at how much dirt and dog hair it suctioned.  At first glance I was a bit apprehensive because it appeared to be very fragile and I break everything.  After putting it together (literally a few clicks 10 minutes) and NOT breaking it, looks like this vacume holds up well.  I vacumed everything I could think of, and for once I didn't have to worry about my vacume cleaner overheating and giving out on me.  The cord is extremely long so I didn't have to worry about having to unplug and plug as I vacumed.  The only bad thing (if you would even call it bad) is that in order to use the attachments, you have to remove the cord from the holders.  If that's the least of my worries, I'm in heaven.

Not a lot of moving parts which is nice and simple to use.  Great to use for both carpet, tile, and wood flooring.  I would have rated this product 5 stars however, it does have some shortcomings.  It would be nice to easily access the brush so that hair and fabric can be easily pulled out.  The front of the vaccum is a bit tall which makes reaching under extended lower cabinets harder to reach, so you ended up having to pull the a accessory tool to reach these areas.  This isn't quite so effective when working with steps, you will need an attachment to vacuum really well.  Just using the vacuum alone on the steps makes it hard to maneuver and when the vacuum is near upright, it shifts some of the suction to the attachment tool.  For it's value and power, it is well worth it.  If you're looking at this product, you might want to check out Costco's version of the package though.  For a few more $$, you can have the same DC33 with the attachments already included."

However, if you or anyone in your family has hair you are in for a real treat when it comes to removing hair from the beater brush. The beater brush bar is not removable. So, you'll get to sit on the floor, and cut and pull hair off the brush bar. This is not the clever engineering I expect from the Dyson company. Removing hair from the beater bar is something everyone needs to do to maintain a vaccum, and there's no easy way to do it with this model. Also, if you displace the belt while trying to clean the brush beater bar you are in for another round of horror trying to get the belt back in the right spot on the bar. So annyoing. The plastic parts holding the beater bar in place on each side are very fragile. It doesn't take much force at all to render your $400 vaccum useless by simply trying to remove hair from the brushbeater bar.There are lots of good things about it that others have mentioned here, but the beater bar issue is a deal breaker for me. Lesson learned."

I had been very happy with my first one.  Did a great job on carpets and bare floors and I have 3 Labs who shed.  I think the plastic housing on the back that holds the wand into the vacuum just wore out and snapped.  So, since you can't get replacement parts for that, I decided to buy a new one.  This new one is lighter in weight and shorter.  That's something I really appreciate being a petite woman.  Before lugging it to the second floor was a chore, now it's easy.  The cord is a bit shorter and the container that you empty a bit smaller but it works just as well as the original.  I'm very glad I bought it.  I also have a Miele that I use upstairs but it doesn't get the dog hair off the carpets the way this Dyson does.  I don't think there's any comparison there and I like not having to buy bags. For those people wondering if they need the animal model of a Dyson, I don't think it's necessary.  However, my dogs are short haired....maybe if you have a long-haired dog, the animal model is a better bet. Otherwise, get this one!"

I was worried about the wand based on other reviews, but have found that even though it is awkward to use, it has strong suction and cleans baseboards, windows, and small areas rather well. I used the wand to clean a couch in my house that I THOUGHT was clean and got two canisters of hair off of it. The long cord is a plus as well. I've been using a shop vac to clean my house for years and that four foot cord kept me agitated! The DC33 works on both the rugs and hard floor very well and I like that the head of the vacuum is flat so it goes right up against the walls getting all of the runaway balls of dogs hair. I love it! I did not purchase through Amazon. I chose to go to Bed, Bath and Beyond and use my 20% off coupon that comes in the mail.

The vacuum is phenomenal for cleaning and you really will be amazed at what it removes from your carpet.  They made a few improvements like the extending wand has a button to unlock it on the handle and the attachments lock in with a click.  My only complaint with the DC33 is the attachments they provide now.  The brush head is much smaller than the old brush and it is fixed to the neck attachment.  Rather than being able to remove it is just slide down over the neck piece and it very narrow.  Not a big problem but after using the old brush attachment and the new one I really like the old version better."

I did expect the plastic to be more heavy duty (feels a little cheap), but perhaps they did that to keep the vacuum itself lighter. I'm hoping this will last many years. I'm giving it a 4 because of a few things - and because I think that the price could be cheaper.- I LOVE the fact that I can vacuum floors - NO more broom! It gets carpets and floors clean fast and there's no left over stuff on the floors (nice for those of us who have babies/crawlers). I've found that since I've used this weekly, our house has been cleaner (less dusty) overall.- I only use attachments in the bathroom because long hair will get stuck in the roller part underneath.- I wish the canister was washable. When we vacuum the area where our dog sleeps the canister retains that smell for a while, but it sucks up dog hair well.- I have noticed some dust on the outside of the vacuum. Not sure why.- Filters were easy to clean - be sure to clean them as instructed. I did notice loss of suction when they weren't cleaned.- Our carpets do look better and less matted down.- The extender part sometimes doesn't want to stay pulled out.- The long cord is really nice, but I agree that a retractable cord would be extra nice!Overall it's way better than our old vacuum and if we get many years of use of out it, I'll be thrilled."

I've now moved to a 1600 sq ft house and want to get a bigger Dyson.  I decided, after thinking about the DC25 and DC28 that the DC33 was the best choice for me, taking price into account, and i only need something simple that has great suction and isn't too heavy. I looked at one at a store, found it to be surprisingly lightweight and about as easy to maneuver as the DC18, though much bigger.  So, i ordered one on Amazon and it was delivered a few days ago.I tried it out, it worked great, i had a few frustrations, most of which could be chalked up to being new to it and there being differences compared to what i was used to with the DC18, and also, i was in a rush at the time so i didn't want to take a lot of time with it.One small frustration was that you can't remove the bin if the cord is wrapped up. It took me a while to figure out why i couldn't get the bin off after i had been able to get it off earlier. Another was that there was an exhaust smell when i was vacuuming the second time and my eyes started burning. I called Dyson and they said it was probably just because it was new and that would go away. I've had that same feeling with other appliances so i was ok with giving it some time.One thing that was a disappointment was that i had invested in a lot of accessory tools with the DC18, flat out (type) tool, mini turbine, soft dusting brush and a few others, mattress tool, etc.  They did not fit with the DC33.  I asked Dyson if they had an adapter for that and they said they did and were ready to send it right out to me, so i appreciate that.  However.... i had not registered yet and am not going to, which brings me to the issue which is causing me to return the vacuum cleaner.  I haven't seen this mentioned in reviews so i guess it means i'm probably just a clutz or something, like it must be my fault, or an assembly glitch on the machine, but what happened just now is, I went to clean the beater brush bar for the first time, it's covered in hair.  The DC18 is simple to clean, the bar is in two sections and they slide out either on the left or the right for cleaning. I already knew the DC33 bar doesn't come out, someone mentioned that in a review.  And in the illustration 'instructions' for the vacuum, it showed a picture of someone removing debris with scissors while the bar was still in the vacuum.I cut the hair with scissors and began pulling it out, trying to pull it off the brush.  I found that on the right side (when facing the bottom of the vacuum while it's laying on its back) the brush bar does pull out, which surprised me at first. When i pulled on the hair, the bar came out on the right side, and then it would go back into place.  Then as i continued to tug on the hair to pull it from the bristles, it snapped or popped and changed position, and i found i could not get it back in. Something got out of alignment and the bar would not fit back inside the casing. i tried and eventually got it forced back in but the bar didn't turn easily and it didn't seem right. I turned it on and not surprisingly, it made the really loud noise that it also made when i pushed it over the edge of a rug a couple of times, that other reviewers have mentioned.This was bad.  I called Dyson and described what happened and she said that i would have to send it in for repair. That's not going to happen.  I don't know if this happened because of my error in pulling on the hair too hard but i don't think this would've happened if there had been written directions warning of a need to be cautious when pulling the hair on the right side. I didn't know there was any problem until it was too late.My experience with two calls to customer service was good. The first representative was pretty abrupt but she was ready to submit a warranty claim even though she was implying it was my fault in saying 'YOU pulled the bar out and YOU pulled the clutch and belt out of alignment.'  She really stressed the word 'you.'  But then when i said i would be returning it to the store instead, she tried to trouble shoot it with me, and was clear and methodical in walking me through the steps. Unfortunately it didn't fix the problem.  My second call was about the exhaust smell/burning eyes and the question about an adapter for the accessories. She was quite a bit more pleasant than the other representative and she made it clear that returning the unit to the store and NOT sending it in for repair was the right choice, and she answered questions i had about comparisons between the different models. Along with other useful information, she gave me all the specifications of the DC 25, DC28 and DC33 which i hadn't been able to find so far.OK, so, i did like the vacuum cleaner while using it. It worked fine, was easy to push around and to lift, it was powerful, it was easy to clean, it's simple which i like, the fewer electronic parts the better, fewer things to wear out and go wrong, compared to the DC28, but i may end up going with the DC28 because it's a lot bigger than the DC25.  I'm definitely disappointed in the way the bar popped out on the DC33, i wasn't using any more force than i've used pulling hair off any other vacuum cleaner. I have an iRobot that i had to give up using because of the frequency that it needed hair taken off, it was more work than any other vacuum i've used. I have a cat and a dog, Cavalier King Charles, pretty hairy. For the iRobot, i bought several cutting tools to make it as quick and easy as possible to get the hair off. I used these on the DC33 but there still is some pulling involved.Im giving 3 stars.  Not giving 5 stars because i don't think it was my fault that the bar popped out and it is not a good experience. Not giving less than 3 stars because before this problem happened, it seemed to work well (i would've waited to review it for a month or two) and met my needs and also, i appreciated the customer support experiences."

First it was a daily chore taking about 30 minutes to dust the entire house, then cleaning the sweeper. What I found out was that my front door has not been properly sealing and letting dust in because every morning my floor in the hall would look like it had not been swept. I then started looking for a new vacuum, my previous vacuum was a Hoover windtunnel, which says it all when it comes to noise. Read hundreds of reviews for vacuums at different sites (some were clearly cut an pasted because they were the same word for word), but I was interested in a Dyson for sometime now. Looked at one of the ball models because of the ease in handling but there was some trade offs on canister size and other things. Finally I decided to purchase the DC33 model. (used my credit card rewards points)and was essentially free. So far I have been happy with this vacuum, as I do not have pets and no carpets, it works very well on my wood floors, if Dyson can come out with a retro fix to solve the tool suction problem, then this would make a good vacuum excellent. Maneuverability on wood floors very easy as it slides around easily. I do have to use a smaller hand held vacuum to vacuum where I would use the tool wand to vacuum, for me that's a large draw back, and for that reason stops me from giving a 5 star rating.Pros: - Much quieter, less noise I can hear my phone ring. - Easy and light to push - Nice long cord, do not have to unplug, can do entire house from a central plug - Nice large container, and easy to empty - Very easy to put together right out of box, less than 10 minutesCons: - Tool suction just sucks, has very little suction, does not even suck up jean pant leg. Leading consumer magazine also noted this - Extension handle a little to big which makes it difficult to reach under master bed, must be turned sideways to slide under bed. - Front of vacuum to high and does not reach base boards under kitchen cabinets"

While the majority of them are positive, and I agree, there are a few negative reviews that are just ridiculous.First, I agree that the extension arm does appear cheap and is awkward to use. Does it work, yes. Does this bother me? Not enough to give the vacuum a terrible review. This is the only reason I give it 4 stars. The handle to the wand is a bit flimsy. I get around this by actually holding the wand itself and not the handle.Other than the above, the suction is fantastic. We purchased this vacuum for our new home. The previous owners had pets and vacuumed and shampooed the carpets before we moved it. The DC33 still pulls up dog and cat hair that the previous owners could not get out of the carpet. I have used this vacuum to clean my car and vacuum up dust from sanding our walls. I havent found any other flaws in it, other then the extension wand.As for the other negative reviews. Someone stated that they were disappointed that they had to unravel the cord themselves? Cmon... You cant expect your vacuum to do everything for you. This just screams lazy. Others have commented that it wont reach under the couch. Well, Then move the damn couch. You can effectively vacuum under your couch completely without moving it anyway. There was one other that states that Dyson was liable for damaging hardwood or linoleum floors because their floors weren't level. How is this the fault of the vacuum? Sounds to me like someone didnt install your floors correctly. Last on that list, the attachments are too complicated to use for your maid? Are you kidding? This thing is really easy to use. Why not try reading the instructions.Why did I get a Dyson? Simple reason, my mother. She has had pets all her life and I have never seen a vacuum pull as much hair out of a rug as her Dyson Animal does. I got a good feel for the vacuum at her house while visiting. We decided on the DC33 because we do not have pets and the Animal was overkill for us.For the best pricing out there, go to banksvac.com. We got our DC33 for $309 shipped.

I have never heard a worse screeching grinding noise in my life! I turned it off, checked for jams, pieces etc and tried again. Same issue. I googled the problem and it seems like everyone who has low pile carpets has this issue. Dyson recommends removing a seal from around the beater to reduce the suction. Pardon me, but isnt the reason we all bought this vacuum for its amazing suction? I have not removed the seal and I live with the noise. Other than that, it works great on my hardwood and tile floors (you can actually see the dogs hair getting pulled from under the couches!) and great on normal carpet (although sometimes I dont see the brush marks on the rug which made me not believe it was actually spinning), however the amount of dirt, fur and dust in the canister proves me wrong.

They wanted $400-500 for one of their Dysons.  We wanted a bagless that could handle pet hair as we have 4 cats.  To make a long story short, we could not justify paying $400-500 for a vacuum when we found the Hoover Wind Tunnel PAWS at Target for $150.00 (including tax).  It has a retractable cord, one washable filter and one replaceable filter.  It comes with a brush that attaches to the hose for vacuuming your furniture.  It's not any heavier than our old vacuum nor is it any noisier.  When the canister gets full, take it to the trash and empty it out.

The vacuum is not very heavy and move around very easily.  The extension hose is a little stiff as others mentioned, but if you stretch it all the way out before you use it, it's not too bad at all.

It does a very good job on both hard floors (hardwood and tile) and carpet. Emptying the cannister is simple.CONS: The wand attachment is so problematic that is almost useless. The coiled hose does not stay extended and I am constantly fighting it as it tries to retract itself.

Nonetheless, you must learn how to use the Dyson, as we did after chucking J. Edgar (our Hoover that had acquired substantial 'dirt' collected from us and others); the machine has its own design parameters which, if _you_ fail to learn to exploit them, may mean that you will be disappointed due to your own shortcomings in this respect, including in the event you fail to investigate myriad helpful videos and similar online resources that, literally, teach how to operate and maintain the machine to an exceedingly fine degree. (Hint: avail yourselves of the online search engines, even YouTube!)  If you bother to appreciate how to apply the DC33 technical design to almost any home or small office environment, we are convinced you will achieve all plausible home cleaning objectives possible given a non-liquid vacuum cleaning machine intended for home use.  OTOH if you choose not to learn new technology, or want it for an industrial shop, perhaps the purchase a Dyson DC33 is not to be recommended.Us:  Middle-aged; frequent 7-continent travelers, backpackers, runners, divers, bikers, and mountain climbers with plenty o' dirt to contribute; no pets (our building doesn't permit them, not even fish); no kids or other family nearby; no car; we both do all cleaning and alternate with the chores and each works 3,000+ hours per year as professionals; we could hire 'help' but lack the trust and never will go there.  Neither has any connection to Dyson or its employees; candidly, our appliances just must work and remains outta the way when unneeded.Cons: The instructional manual, to be proper, could occupy the volume of a modest novel and Dyson does not provide such as hardcopy or even online. Perhaps not the best product for those to the left of the Gaussian curve.  Large staircases might be better addressed utilizing a second machine designed for the particular environment.  Liquids, especially kitchen or garage, well those spilled depositions are a big no-no.Pros: DC33 is readily disassembled and maintained at home. The rigid wand detaches and you can easily connect endpoint attachments directly to the hose coupling for close-in work.  Powerful suction that sustains despite a large volume of material caught in the debris bin.  A long power cord.  Easy and convenient release of the debris bin.  Maneuverable and light in weight.  We recommend Dyson DC33 to our friends and would buy it again."

It may wear out after a while. But with all things like this time will tell. It held together with pressure, its not 100 inserted into the one another.The attachment hose is Long, and you have to pull it out to use it properly. This would have been better if it was shorter, but an easy work around is having the vacuum a few feet away from you and it works great then. This is not a design flaw because if you have 10Ft ceilings you need the length.I clean the floor in 1 carpet room, then switch to hardwoods and do the second room with out having to shut is off.The brushes pick up hair and get wrapped around but that is common with all vacuums, and the quarter release clips are great. No tools to use, and no pieces to lose. Snaps in snaps out and your done cleaning the brushes. The rubber belt is also protected from dirt and other items by this plate. Not common with any other vacuum I have ever used.Hardwood is a breeze, has not left a single mark on mine in the month we have been using it.The first time I used it I had to empty the container every time I was done with a room.

"234","XX","B0043EW354","4.0","February 23, 2011","A3JS9E97JYTSIK","An Amazing Product, definitely worth it","It's a 4 star rating, but that's only because I'm one of those that reserves 5 stars for the most amazing of things.This review will have two parts.  First, just an overall review and second, why I chose this over the DC25 (which is what I was pretty much decided on until I ran across a DC33 on the floor at a local store).This is my first Dyson, and after reading all the reviews it seems like the majority of people love it, and a few hate it and it seemed like mechanical problems were pretty common.  I've only owned for a short time, but I just don't see this vacuum giving me any problems **assuming you take care of it like you would have to any vacuum***. The sucking power is amazing, we vacuum our home once a week and after giving the dyson a quick run over all our floors (carpet, tile and wood); i ended up having to empty the canister 3 times.  On tile and wood, you can see hairs being sucked in from a few feet away.  From carpets it picked up very very fine dust.  Emptying the canister really is extremely easy. Reaching the filters to wash (at least once every 3 months) is incredibly easy and it even has easy ways to check and clean the vacuum for possible clogs.The main negatives of this vacuum is the wand can be a little awkward to use.  I think that's just inherent in any wand tool.  It's definitely not 'useless' as I always use it here and there, just be prepared for the sucking to start as soon as you put the vacuum upright which other reviews have noted.  You can either just be aware that it'll happen, or you can turn off the vacuum before switching to the wand.  (the on/off button is easy to reach so it's not much of a hassle really)The actual vacuum is a little bulky so you can't maneuver underneath low furniture.  It did go underneath my dining table with no problems. and I don't really have any other furniture that i need to go under.those are really the only two cons i see for this.  some people complain that it's made of 'cheap plastic'.  It's made of polycarbonate plastic.  Known for being incredibly durable yet being extremely light.  And the vacuum is indeed pretty light for the size. It glides just as easy as any other vacuum i've used.Now, why did I choose this over the DC25? Wife tried pushing both around the store and didn't find the DC25 any easier to maneuverer.  Some people do, so just give it a try. But honestly even if the DC25 does move easier, it's a $100 more.  Second, the DC33 has more sucking power.  It's a vacuum. It needs to suck, more sucking power = better in my book.  Third, it has a much larger canister.  I think twice the size if i remember the numbers correctly off of dyson's website.  Fourth,  it's electric cord is 10ft longer.  I can vacuum my whole master bedroom and bathroom without unplugging the thing once.  These 4 reasons just made it a much more practical buy than the D25 in my book so that's why I went with this model instead.Either way, after being hesitant for a few months by some of the bad reviews Dyson gets, i am throughly satisfied.  The wand isn't as easy as I wish, but wand use for me is very secondary and it still has its use.  It almost seems like the air in my house is cleaner after getting rid of all the dust embedded in my carpets / rugs.  The design of how to clean the canister, filters and vacuum itself makes usually very tough tasks, quite simple."

It is less that 2 years old & was lightly used. A replacement hose is $50.Not happy. Fortunately there is Duct Tape, but if I wanted a trashy-looking vacuum I would not have paid for a Dyson.I think because of the Dyson 'hype' many people - including myself - expect the ultimate machine.cons:* I had a cheap Hoover bagless that died after 3 years. The canister would always have a layer of fine particles - but the Dyson seems to pick up less fine particles. The Hoover canister would be full after a vacuuming, the Dyson only  has a couple of inches of fur, etc. Maybe it compresses the dirt more? *The Dyson vents out the front under the canister and blows dust away from the machine - sending dust bunnies scooting.[In the NYT today there was an article on dust. It said that much of the dust on furniture comes from disturbing the dust on the floor while cleaning].* Using the machine is not intuitive - unlike others I've had that came out of the box and you knew just what to do...I had to read the instructions to figure out how it worked. The air blowing out the top of the handle had me stumped at first. I thought there was a piece missing.* Using the wand is not intuitive - it is awkward and takes some getting used to.* Pricey - I paid 319 at Lowes - a good deal, but still pricey.I am hoping that it lasts a long time - that will make it cost effective.pros:*The machine appears to be well built and it looks good.* After using the Dyson a few more times I am liking it better. It is getting easier to use now that I understand it better, but I still dread having to use the wand because it takes some doing to unsnap & get it snapped back onto the machine.* It's a good cleaner, gets the job done.* It picks up kitty litter very well. All my other machines made the litter kick out under the machine. The Dyson picked up every crumb cleanly"
"236","XX","B0043EW354","5.0","February 9, 2011","A1BV5S9NA9IQ7V","GREAT vacuum!!","I did a lot of research before I bought this Dyson and almost got the DC28 Animal one because I have a large dog that sheds.  After doing some reading online, I found out this is the exact same machine as the animal except for the attachments!  That's the only difference!  So I decided for $200 less than the Animal one I could do without the 'special' attachments.  The very first time I pulled this out of the box and used it in my living room I wasn't all that impressed, especially with the suction but I decided to go over my floor again and practice with the attachments.  Well, it must have just needed to warm up or something being brand new because the second time the suction was amazing!!  (and ever since!)  It left the lines on the carpet from where I had vacuumed (I love that!) and it also fluffed up the carpet and made it feel like when we first bought the carpet and our feet sank down in it a bit!! Very cool!!  And the best part - it picked up the dog hair!!!!!  With my old vacuum I would still get dog hair on my clothes even after vacuuming but I tested my Dyson:  After vacuuming with it the first day I had my toddler drag a clean black shirt all over the carpet - and guess what? - not a single dog hair was on it!! Every time I've used it since the suction has been amazing!Below I wanted to address some of the negatives I have read in reviews about it.  I was glad I ignored them and bought this anyway!  :)- I was impressed with the suction from the side of it.  With the front you can't get right up to the baseboards but if you can run the side of the vacuum against it, it works good (or just use the wand).  On another note about the front - no it won't get under furniture or the edge of things.  The high profile of the front of the vacuum prevents that but that was ok with me.  With this kind of strong suction I wouldn't want to be vacuuming where I can't see what it might grab anyway!  And you can tell by looking at the picture that it won't do this before you buy.. not sure why some people are surprised by this.- THE WAND: this did take some practice but I like it fine.  Some have said the vacuum tips over when you are trying to use it but I haven't had that happen at all.  In fact, when I've been using the wand on the baseboards and walk and pull, the vacuum has actually rolled along behind me like a canister vacuum would do following me!  Just make sure the back of the vacuum where the wand was is facing you so it can roll along with you while you walk.  I also read several reviews saying the wand will suck your shirt sleeve in (because the wand is the handle and the suction switches to the wand when the vacuum is in the upright position.)  But I have a very simple fix for this - TURN THE VACUUM OFF BEFORE putting it to the upright position. Not sure why you would need or want it on while getting the wand or attachments out and ready anyway.  Just turn it off before switching. (and the same when starting to vacuum - recline it first, THEN turn it on.)  One more thing on the wand - I will say that it would be easier if the long end piece was flexible or if the hard section wasn't so long.  It is a bit awkward at first figuring out the best way to use it. I found that if you just back up a bit from what you are trying to vacuum it gives room for you to manuever the long wand.  Just don't get so close and it's no big deal. I will say it IS nice though to have a long hard section wand to get cobwebs on high cielings.- Unlike what some have said, this vacuum is NOT heavy!  They must have been comparing it with a swiffer mop or something because as far as regular vacuums go I was very happy with the weight!  (go to a store and pick them up to compare.)  It's actually much lighter than most I tried out in the stores.  It is easy to push even on my thick carpet!  It's not bulky either and I find it very manuevarable.  In fact I tried out the 'ball' dyson in the store and didn't think it was any more manueverable than the regular one. I also didn't like the release on the ball one (that reclines it to vacuum than clicks it to upright.)  I had to use such force to push on the foot lever to get it to recline that I could see it breaking after awhile.  Not sure if that was just an issue with the floor model or what but I'm very glad I didn't get the ball type.  (the canister is smaller on those too!)- THE CANISTER: is VERY easy to dump.  My old bagless vacuum you had to take the top off the canister and actually dig out the junk.  This one has a very handy release on it:  You take the canister off the vacuum (with one hand at the click of a button!), and while holding it down in the trash can, you push the button that opens the BOTTOM of the canister letting all the junk fall out the bottom down into the trash.  Now you do have to use your fingers to then close the bottom up, but come on - two fingers with a little dust is much better than most!  And it's easy enough to just wash my hands afterwards.- NOISE LEVEL:  It's pretty quiet as far as vacuums go.  My young kids used to be afraid of my vacuum and would run for cover every time I got it out.  The first time I used this one they not only came out in shock that it wasn't some monster going to eat them but they actually skipped across in front of it playing while I vacuumed!- BARE FLOOR TO CARPET LEVER:  Some have said this is a hard thing to do... that confuses me because it is just a wheel like switch on the front of the vacuum that you just turn to 'bare floor' or 'carpet'.  Ok, so you do have to bend down... is that a problem? .. I don't think so.  (sorry for the sarcasm. lol)OK, so after all the good now I will share the short bad.  The ONLY problem I have had with this at all:It tends to leave a clump of dog hair at the last place it was standing when I'm done and turn it off.  I realized though this was probably because I was turning it off so fast when I was done that the last thing it picked up hadn't made it up into the canister yet.  I solved this problem by letting it run for a few seconds in the same position when I was done before turning it off.  That lets all the last stuff it picks up get up into the canister so when I turn it off there's no clump left.  It was a simple fix I just remember to do each time when I'm finished.  I'm happy to do that little thing for the benefit of all that dog hair being gone!  :)So overall I am VERY pleased with this vacuum and highly recommend it - especially if you have pets."

What a disappointment!Suction is poor and it will not go underneath furniture unless it a 1 foot off the floor. After spending $400 on a vac we need to spend more money to buy an attachment to reach under furniture that an $80 el cheap-o-lah vacuum will easily reach under? Oh and you know that little 3 inch area under your countertops in the kitchen? Well, forget cleaning it with the Dyson. It doesn't even leave a nice neat brush stroke on the carpet so you know your carpet is clean.Did I mention the poor suction, on another note if you have long hair expect to clean the brush bar every other time you use this hunk of junk. This junker is NOT light weight and is like pushing a dead freaking fish along the carpet. I want back my $80, self propelled, hepafilter, bagless, lightweight cheap-o-lah that sucked air like a jet engine!And this brings me to the telescoping wand.  For starters, the quick release is in an awkward position.  This means you are more than likely going to turn the vacuum off when trying to release the wand.  Once it does release, you will find that the handle is positioned in a way to make it very uncomfortable to use.What I'm really pissed about is that for $320 more than the little champ I used to have, I expected the Dyson to suck the paint off a 57 Chevy, not suck you know what.  If I could give it a negative 5 star rating, I would!The really sad thing is that we took the first Dyson back because it didn't suck at all and really expected an improvement over the one with broken brush bar.  What a waste of money!"

My daughter's comment recently was that it worked well."

For the $399.00 retail it should have been fabulous!  Unfortunately it didn't measure up to its price.Pros: It was lighter than my old Hoover Wind tunnel vac which made it easy to get up and down the stairs, and I really loved the long chord!  I liked the fact that the filters are washable and don't need to be replaced. The suction at the front edge of this vacuum was great.  Unfortunately that was the only place that it pulled dirt up well.Cons: As I stated the frontal suction was great, however the side edging was horrible!  I tried to suck up tinsel next to the upstairs railing in my home after Christmas. No matter how many times I went past the stuff it just would not lift from the side edge.  When I turned and ran the vac over the tinsel from the front it finally came up.  This happened in a few spots.  Needless to say that if you were in tight quarters and couldn't turn the vacuum you would have to use the hand held wand.  On that note, let me say that this vac does have a long hose...if you can get it to stay extended.  The hard plastic nozzle at the end is great if you are sucking cobwebs off of the ceilings but you can't bend the thing around for closer items.  And as I said, the hose (while it was new at least) didn't want to stay stretched out. So unfortunately this feature was basically useless for me.  This vacuum vents the air at the front so when you go to use it on hard wood floors or tile the dust bunnies all float away from you and you end up trying to run them down before they get away.  It might be an amusing diversion if you had the time...! If you are a dust allergy sufferer I would steer clear of any of the bagless vacuums that I've seen, including this one.  Removing the dust from the bin can get you covered in the stuff (Even if you put it in a bag and then open the bottom trap door). The dust gets trapped somewhat inside the canister and then you have to tap and bang on the cheap feeling plastic to get it all out.  By that time you are covered in dust! I would wonder how long the plastic would hold up to the dust removal process as well.Overall it was a so-so vacuum.  But with a large dog and kids running through the house it wasn't any bargain for me!  The price was too much for its usefulness."

The Dyson DC33 cleans very well.  I re-vacuumed the floors 2-3 days after vacuuming with the previous vacuum I owned.  Visibly, there was a lot of dirt in the canister that the previous vacuum did not pick up.The machine is well designed and constructed and easy to use.  Taking apart the canister and wand attachment is very intuitive.  The only things I don't like about the machine is the weight of the machine and the springiness of the wand tube, which makes it difficult to use, as it is always pulling the wand back."

It was a super special in the store, never saw it for that price before or after.The vacuum provides great suction. More the power of a shop vac for the rug. Picked up things you wish it didn't, dust, dirt, sand! I live in the NE - inland.  So for that part it is great.  I knew it wouldn't fit under furniture - duh!  For those who complaining about it, you  saw it before you bought it.  The wand works very well in lieu of getting under, just remember un crimp it before you use it and the hose is flexible.  What seems like a good thing is a little annoying is the empty canister activity.  All the junk you pulled up just flies from the end of the canister.  You have to hold it deep enough in the garbage or a bag and then toss it.  I have a lot more dust around the garbage after I empty it. It's okay though.The beater slips sometimes and I have to look at it.  Overall the quality is okay, not great. The constant clipping and un clipping of things with plastic are bound to get loose and break., but for the right price it is worth it.  I tell people to get one if they need a vacuum.  I actually like this better then the ball one; the head was too floppy when I tried to lift the whole thing to do the steps. So again this one after much research has done well so far for me."

However when we moved to out new condo, which has about 650 square feet of medium pile carpet in the huge bedroom and 3 levels (2 flights of stairs) and I found the canister much less convenient for this arrangement. SO I decided to sell the DC21 and buy a cheaper upright vac. I got the Hoover T series bagged ('HEPA' bag - I put that in quotes because it's not a true HEPA system) Windtunnel but I was very unhappy with it - poor suction which I was not able to fix, the door of the bag compartment wouldn't close tightly which may have contributed to poor suction, and the plastic parts were very cheaply made. I very much missed my Dyson and was unhappy that I'd sold it for the inferior Hoover. I returned the Hoover and went shopping for a Dyson upright, resigned to spending more money than I'd been able to sell my used Dyson for.I tried out the Ball models and I liked the agility and flat front that would fit under cabinets, but the DC24 in my price range had a very small dirt bin, and less suction than the DC33 and a more fiddly wand assembly. The DC25 is great but a lot more expensive. I decided to go with the DC33 and I like it - light enough to carry up stairs, but very powerful cleaning. I plan to buy a mini turbine head to clean under furniture with the wand attachment. The dirt bin is easy to empty into a bag without puffing dirt all over, important for allergy suffers. And the air exhaust is clean smelling and doesn't trigger my allergies as I vacuum. And like all Dysons, it has major cleaning power!"

The only good thing on this vacuum is the suction -- but other vacuums with 12A power have the comparable suction.For a company that claims to solve the design flaws in uprights, they created all new ones.  Most people cited the issue with the wand/hose and attachments but said it didn't bother them -- it wouldn't be a big deal if you could actually reach a couple of inches under the sofa or table, but given the dimensions of the vacuum you can't - and if the wand is hard to use, it makes the entire vacuum hard to use.Point by point, here is why you should NOT buy1) complex to use, my house cleaner was totally confused as I explained to her how to use the wand, the attachments, and how to reinstall the cup2) the hose wand is very difficult and cumbersome to use -- the wand is too long and the unwieldy3) the attachments are worthless and you can't use them to properly clean stairs4) it's bulky, far bulkier than the Eureka and Hoovers I've used5) because the wand is not functional, you can't get under any furniture6) all the pieces click into place -but are flimsy -- lots of opportunity for breakage if you force it a little too much or don't align it perfectly7) the vacuum falls over when you you try to use the wand8) when you put the vac in upright position the suction comes from the top of the wand immediately so it you have to quickly shut it off, it grabs my sleeves 9) there are no multiple carpet pile levers10) the location of the bare floor vs. carpet is very cumbersome to use11) the unit is heavier than my other two uprights that had similar power and better functions12) the height on the head of the vacuum is too big so you can't even get a few inches under the sofa13) no retractable cord (not really a big deal -- but for the price -- I'm throwing it in as a con14) the handle is not ergonomically designed well.  I'm short and I feel like I had to bend over as I moved the vacuum forward.I bought on BF for 30% off - it was still $300 -- not worth it.  My $150 vacuum lasted 13 years, was as good at picking up stuff from my plush carpet and oriental rugs, and had a functional wand and functional attachments.this thing is POS. seriously.  save your cash.

"247","XX","B0043EW354","4.0","November 30, 2010","ASXZ641ZNDLVR","Superb on floors, but the dust wand is a bit inconvenient","This is a great sweeper, and it really excells at cleaning floors.  The 2010 holiday cyber week saw a handful of retailers discounting the DC33 heavily, which made the deal hard to ignore, especially since the motor bearings on my 25 year old Eureka canister vac were shot.The construction of the DC33 is mostly of well fitting high quality plastic parts that look like they should hold up well to a number of years of use.  The ergomics of the machine are pretty good, especially for floor cleaning.  When the DC33 is parked upright, vacuum is vented through the handle, which doubles as the dusting wand.  Some users reported that was off-putting, but it doesn't bother me.  That keeps a good air flow to the high speed motor and prevents burning out the motor with over speed from too much suction.  And, yes the TV ads seem to be correct in that the DC33 has a lot of suction power.  I've previously had serveral upright sweepers, and they're quite wimpy compared to the DC33.  While the others relied mainly on the brush roll to kick up dirt, which was lazily scooped into a bag, the DC33 really pulls the dirt.  The fist time I went over my carpet with the Dyson, I was surprised at the amount of crud it pulled out.  The really long 35 foot power cord is a nice touch too.  I can reach most of my house without having to re-plug the cord.  The motor isn't silent, but it is quiet enough that it doesn't send my cats running when I switch the DC33 on.The DC33 is bagless, but not totally maintenance free.  There are pre and post filters that need to be periodically washed.  I've used the DC33 several times, and the filters still pretty much look pristine despite having dumped dust collector quite a few times.  The manual is a bit dodgy on how often the filters should be washed, but does give a good illustration of the procedure for doing so.While I am cheery about the quality and power of the DC33, it isn't all peaches and cream.  There are a few week spots.  The bulk of the design makes it hard to sweep under beds or low furniture.  It is better to move things like coffee tables and beds if you need to clean far underneath the edge.  The wand's combo brush/crevice tool isn't much help in the cleaning underneath department becuase the brush is pretty dinky; you'll spend a lot of time with such a small brush.  That's where a canister vac will do better.  If cleaning under things frequently is a must for you, then you might want to consider one of the higher end Kenmore canister vacs as an alternative.  The other mote in the DC33's eye is the somewhat clutzy design of the wand.  While the wand is a bit more convient to stow than the likes of Hoover attachment tools, the problem stems from the rather long wnad stowing inside the hose.  When the wand is extended, it sticks way out from the end of the hose, and it is hard to get a good angle for dusting bick-a-brack on dresser tops and waist level flat surfaces.  On the other hand, the wand is really great for reaching up and nabbing cob webs from high ceiling corners.Over all, the DC33 is a good bargain when it is discounted.  It would be hard to find a better machine for carpet cleaning.  I'd have to think twice, however, at the list price of $399 --  I would have to give consideration to the very capable Sears Kenmore canister vacs at that price point becuase they're be handier for cleaning under beds and doing stairs.EDIT 14-February-2011I figured out that it is possible to detach the wand and sick the crevice tool or upholstery tool directly into the end of the hose.  I'm not sure that it is what Dyson intended; the manual doesn't say anything about attaching the tools that way, but it is unbelieveably easier than trying to use the tools on the end of the wand (except for stairs and ceiling corners).Since figuring this out I will up my rating of the DC33 to 4.5 stars.  The DC33 still loses half a star becuase it is too bulky to sweep easily under low furniture such as beds and coffee tables."
"248","XX","B0043EW354","4.0","November 26, 2010","A1AULUWALMGDV1","Great vacuum","I read the 1 and 2 star reviews before we purchased. We are very pleased with this vacuum so far.The good:The suction is great, and emptying the canister is a breeze. The cord is long (35') and it weighs less than it looks. I ran my old unit, then this, and it picked up more (stuff). It glides across the floor easily even with the 2 wheels. You can easily switch from the roller to non roller for non carpet floors.The bad:I will have to agree that for the cost, some of the plastic parts seem flimsy. Nothing that feels like it is going to snap off, but flimsy feeling none the less. The only weird thing is the auto top suction switch. This is a minor annoyance, but the only real complaint here. I will try to explain:The wand feature works in reverse. The suction comes out the top instead of the bottom of the wand. The wand is essentially the handle and when the vacuum is upright, the wand starts the suction. This is right where your hand, sleeve, watch, bracelet, was a second ago. As soon as you click the vacuum in the upright position, it switches from bottom suction to wand suction. Not a big deal, but if you have on a long sleeve shirt, it can catch you off guard.Summary: A great vacuum. I hope it provides years of dirt pickup and we may buy another."

Work best when vacuum wood and tile floors. For kitchen, as long there's 4-1/4' clearance from top of floor to bottom of cabinet, DC33 will clean everything.

"250","XX","B0043EW354","4.0","November 17, 2010","A1F09METOUKOCH","DC33 vs DC25","I have tried both of these, and have come to the conclusion that the DC33 is superior. Here's why:-The suction and brush bar are clearly more powerful. This is what sold me. I can see the difference in carpet lines (medium pile carpet) when I use one or the other.-35ft cord is a significant benefit over the 25ft cord. I can almost do the entire floor by just plugging in a single outlet. Two would cover the whole house. With the DC25, I had to constantly unplug and replug.-Larger dustbin means I can keep vacuuming for longer without emptying. Also, the design on this one seems to keep the shroud (the perforated shield inside the canister) freer of stuck-on dust.-Quieter-Although a bit larger, it is a similar weight to the DC25.-Critical sections can be easily taken apart to clear blockages.-The DC25 has a tiny plastic piece that keeps the vacuum from tipping over in upright mode due to the ball mechanism. If I tilt the vacuum to the side while it is close to being upright, I can hear a loud snap as the plastic piece is forced into a position where it shouldn't be. I can see this breaking really soon.There are some shortcomings:-The wand is a clear cost cutting measure. It is plastic rather than aluminum. Also, the handle is missing (present in the DC25) a contoured plastic piece that makes it much more ergonomic to hold when using the wand. It also requires an extra button to release AND another button to retract the wand. Lastly, when you release the wand from the hose, there is just a bare hose, rather than a similar cuff as the one at the end of the wand with a release button as on the DC25. It is still usable, but not as nice. It just adds to the already cumbersome wand system on the Dysons.-The DC33 switches suction to the wand when in upright position whereas the DC25 switches it when the wand is drawn. A minor annoyance, especially if you're wearing a long sleeved shirt; it may  get sucked in when you hold the handle.-No ball, but to me the difference in maneuverability is negligible.Update 3/4/2011: I have used this vacuum for a few months now. I returned the DC25 and do not miss it at all. The DC33 continues to perform admirably. True to Dyson's claim, the suction is as good as new. I've washed the filters once and the process was simple, much simpler than going to the store and buying filter bags. Vacuuming is a pleasure, due to getting the instant gratification of seeing the the dust collect in the bin, and the clean exhaust. It's probably subconscious, but as a sufferer of seasonal allergies and constant nasal congestion, I feel like I can breathe better when I vacuum.The only pain has been removing hair from the brush bar. It doesn't pop off, unlike the DC25, so removing hair can be a cumbersome process."

It doesn't feel sturdy, or well made.  I had to go over small strings multiple times to get them up from the carpet, I would think that should be an easy pick up!  I didn't like the way you had to fiddle with two buttons to pull out the long hose from the top & it was very awkward to use.  The vacuum kept tipping over when I'd use it & then it would shut off without me knowing it because it the hose only sucks in a certain position.  I also found that when in 'idle' position...the top of the vacuum sucks your sleeve in if you go near it because that is where the hose part comes from (hard to explain).  Its fine as long as you are in 'vacuuming position' because then the top suction part shuts off.But, the worst part for me was that this vacuum wouldn't reach under my kitchen cupboards to the baseboard.  You have to take out the hose & use it on the edges of the floor because the front of the vacuum is so high that it stops before getting under the cupboards all the way.  I don't think we have deeper than normal cupboards, so can you imagine not being able to just vacuum the kitchen floor without struggling with that awkward hose to do the entire perimeter of the kitchen?!?Anyway, back it went & I'm going with Hoover.  Should have listened to the sales girl!!!"

Its suction is incredible, the beater-bar does a great job on big carpets.  Emptying the canister is genius simple - just hold it over the garbage can, press the button, and you are done!  It is relatively lightweight for an upright, and the way it all clips together it is very easy to carry around and up/down stairs.  It also looks cool for a vacuum, so my kids want to play with it (for now, anyway).  Way less hassle than my old FilterQueen with four seperate pieces to lug around!Here's what I would have liked to have known in advance:  The super suction means it tries to eat small throw carpets, and you have to ackwardly put a foot on both ends of the carpet to keep it down while you vacuum it; Although it does have a very long reach when the wand is removed from the upright, the flexible tube is so springy it pulls back on itself and drags the upright part around while you are trying to use the wand part.  It says it reaches 17ft - but effectively it is only usable for about 6-8 feet because of the springiness.  It is really only a FLOOR vacuum, as it cannot be used for things like vacuuming the car, or dusting around stuff on top of the piano or mantle, as the business end of the wand is a four foot straight tube - the flexibility is all at the motor end of the wand.  It does not go under any furniture, but I can live with that."

Buying a dyson will make the landfills smaller and great for our planet. Less people throwing away their vaccuum cleaners every year. I owned a dyson dc14 model. I never had any problems and it never lost suction. I could see the hair and dust from my hardwood floors attract to my vaccum like a magnet. The hair and dust would be 12 inches away and the stuff just flew accross the floor and right into the vaccuum. We have 2 large dogs and 4 cats and this vaccuum gets all the hair up. I even vaccuum my dog with it. lol. He likes it. I had the dc14 model for a year before I had to replace it cause the dog chewed the cord. This dc33 model is just like the dc14. Looks the same and everything. The only thing I miss from my dc14 is the metal hose. The dc33 has a plastic hose. I would assume that it makes no difference. Maybe the metal hose would last longer? Other than that I love the dc33 model just as much as the dc14 model. The dc33 model works exactly the same as the dc14 model and I have seen no problems. Great suction and everything.

My husband and I had a Eureka Maxima, and it clogged all the time, lost suction (from the clogging), and the hose kept falling out. You can only blow a vacuum out so many times with an air compressor before you get sick of it. So, one night, we went shopping for a vacuum. We've wanted a Dyson for so long, and we pushed different models around the store for hours. We finally decided on this one.Pros:-Big canister makes it easy to vacuum for awhile without having to dump (this canister is also bigger than the Ball models).-15 foot cord!!-Quiet. Yes, this vacuum is quiet.-Unmatched suction-Picks up cat hair, dust, dander, dirt, and everything else without a hitch.

But it is definitely worth the price. We have 4 long-haired, shedding, exploding cats. They have sterlite tubs as litter boxes and get litter everywhere. It gets into the carpet (we live in an apartment), behind baseboards, just everywhere. Our old vacuum picked up the surface litter but we just couldn't get the embedded litter out no matter how hard we tried. Our house smelled like cat, even after scooping twice a day.

That was the straw that broke my back and made me start looking for a new vacuum.  I didn't want to look at Kirby's since their prices were so insane. Plus, they were heavy.I did some heavy research and I found this one.  I even did a comparison against the Kirby which technically I think it lost. However, I was looking at quality, price point and suction.  Dyson always advertised that they never lose suction.  That part is very true!  I have this shed happy Japanese Akita dog.

Then I took my old Hoover and tested it out against this Dyson and I really did find that this Dyson worked extremely well.  I saw more suction and more dirt come out of my carpet then ever before.I think there are three small drawbacks that I have gotten used to: (1) The extension hose tool that they give you is extremely long.  I wish it was more adjustable in the length but it does help when it comes to my stairs. I have gotten used to this but I don't love it. (2) The waste can is kind of small.  I find myself going to toss the waste away 2x more often.  Again, this is just a little annoyance but I've gotten used to it.

I used this vacuum for five minutes and 95% of the hair ended up wrapped around the brush, the remaining 5% went into the container and this process of clogging the brush up with hair caused all the dirt on my floor to stay on the floor.2. This vacuum is too powerful for area rugs.  It sucks the rug off the floor and causes the brush to stop and start clanking itself against the plastic insides. And you think I am kidding, the customer service at Dyson told me this was the case and I should return it for a less powerful model made for area rugs, perhaps the Dyson balls or DC24.3. The 'detachable' hose for vacuum is extremely clunky.  It is a long bar with a big hose attached and this happens to also be the handle you vacuum with on a rug.  Its not that it doesn't work, it is just not the ideal scenario."

We have been living in our house for almost two years and in that time we have burned through three other vacuums. (A Dirt Devil, Hoover, and some other brand from Home Depot.) I bought this on sale on black friday, and it is seriously the best vacuum I have ever used. It has amazing suction power, the dirt canister is very easy to empty, and the cord is very long. I can plug my vacuum in one outlet and just about vacuum my entire downstairs. I read other reviews about this vacuum having a really stiff coil on the attachment, and while I do agree it was VERY stiff when we first used it, pulling it out a few times helped a lot and now that isn't an issue. I will update this review as i continue to use it.UPDATE: While this is still the best vacuum I have owned the coil is ridiculously stiff. No amount of stretching it fixed the issue. Whenever I use it the vacuum ends up falling over. It is very annoying. Still for the price I paid you can't beat it."

In my small bathroom the base of the vacuum cleaner was too wide to sweep between the toilet and shower and the toilet and the vanity.  However, the floor sweeping attachment is easy to use.  First, using the attachment, I sweep around the perimeter and areas where the sweeper won't go, then finish with the vacuum cleaner.  Things I don't like:  1) the base of the unit is too wide for my taste and makes it difficult to move around, 2) the vacuum is too heavy for me and makes it difficult to use, 3) it doesn't hold that much lint so you have to repeatedly empty the clear bin.

I bought it based on CR rating as the best at the time (Eureka Boss is still close to top today too) and I thought 10 years ago that $179 was not cheap when I could have gotten a $100 dirt devil but went with the ratings.My wife has been 'hinting' that we need a new vacuum for a couple of years which I kind of ignored as  A: the Boss worked fine still for carpet and B: We have 2 (big and small) shop vac's for the needed 'attachment' type cleaning.I would never in a million freakin years spend over $200 let alone $300 on a vacuum. I have known all about Dyson's for years and have heard all the raves. I attribute this to the likes of those those 'Apple Zombie' types. My wife's grandmother raves about by her Dyson yet I think she was just 'foolish' to waste that much money on a vacuum....or so I thought....So on Black Friday I am relaxing and playing with the kids (have never and will never go shopping on this day as it is rest and Christmas light day). I was checking my e-mail and got a 'Black Friday' e-mail from Sams Club. One of several 'featured items' was a DC33 for $249 plus free shipping. Now I have not been able to figure out what my wife wants for Christmas because she does not tell me (or as a man I just forget those hints over the year) so I thought bam! that was easy. I placed the order and told her (yea early surprise). She was shocked I did it knowing my 'cheapness' but very thankful....gosh we have been married too long where a vacuum brings joy.So it gets delivered and I try it out. We are in a brand new home as of April with hard wood floors in all living areas and brand new Armstrong Smart Strand carpet only in the bedrooms. We have a strict no shoe policy in the house, no animals, and my wife vaccums at least twice a week so the bedroom carpet is very clean...so I thought! We did one bedroom and I was 'SHOCKED' at how much crap the Dyson pulled out of the carpet that was just vacuumed the day before. I mean like half a canister of dirty, dusty, linty, crap!By the second room we had to empty the canister WOW! Not only did it pull nasty stuff out of my kids carpets but the carpet felt different...like brand new when it was installed 7 months ago...We have high quality Smart Strand but I had not realized how it lost its smooth and sheeny feel which the Dyson replaced.Next a high pile area rug bought from IKEA in July that was already getting matted down. These are made of Olefin so I assumed the matted was from the everyday vacuuming and the fibers slowly melting from heat friction. WOW the Dyson got a whole canister of crap from that rug and it is no longer matted.Bottom Line! BUY A DYSON!! I would pay full retail knowing what I know now if I had to do it all over again! That says a lot for me plus I don't often write reviews! Their COMMERCIAL is dead on..'If it says it works like a Dyson...it is not a Dyson! I actually thought that any vacuum is just as good and Dyson that was is all HYPE! The Eureka Boss is still a top rated contender for cleaning....uh um yea...look at the Dyson canister after the Boss does several runs and that is all I need to know!This company builds quality and it is clear! Plus it has great features and 'design' ideas that are very god and practical...like a 35 foot cord, like no hard snap to unlock the top and bottom half to cleaning(just gently push down with your foot and you are ready...now my kids can vacuum as they could not unlock the Boss) and so much more....love the hand tool LONG! hose with recoil and the fact it is in the handle...we can now reach 10 foot high spots like air vents that we had to 'lift' all three of our old vacuums up to....and someone actually complained about this feature..come on!As for the bad reviews.....people are morons! Yes it is hard to push but the light weight makes up for that (at least vs the Boss / beast the Dyson is much easier for us) I can see that a Dirt Devil / Orek type user would hate this as it does dig in and is hard to push BUT!!! the reason it is hard to push however is good? because it is actually doing its job....digging in and sucking the crap that the easy to push vacs leave!If you want a clean house and clean carpet BUY THIS! 5 Year Warranty Included vs 1 Year With Others..DONE!

For the negative: what, for this price no auto-retract feature for the cord. Really? More importantly, as others have written, if you have any plush or shag rugs this is not a good vacuum - it gloms onto them, jams, and the beater bar starts whining and/or making rattling noises sounding like it's breaking into pieces. You cannot vacuum thick rugs easily at all. Lastly, the wand is hard to manage (I think due to the suction).

DO NOT BUY!","The Dyson DC33 is one Dyson to RUN FROM!We bought one, & right out of the box, the DC33 made LOUD grinding noises EVERY time we attempted to use it on a carpet.I called Dyson & was told that this was 'normal' & that the grinding was because something must have been blocking the brushes.They further explained that the grinding was actually a protection device to protect the gears & belt of the unit when something is blocking the brushes from turning.With the Dyson person on the phone, I checked everything that the Dyson person said to look at....Well...Surprise, surprise there was NOTHING blocking the brushes on the Brand New DC33 that was simply taken out of the box & then plugged in.Next, the Dyson person told me to take the bottom off the brush area & remove a rubber gasket to 'reduce suction'. Why? Because, as it was explained, the motor on the DC33 is just 'so powerful' that it is actually getting stuck on the carpet because of the 'powerful suction'....Yup....you read that correctly....The Dyson person told me to remove a gasket to REDUCE suction! I may be wrong here, but isn't the powerful suction of the Dyson the whole reason you want to buy one??I mean, their entire ad campaign is based on '..the vacuum that never loses suction'...& here is a Dyson Customer Service person telling me procedures to reduce the suction of a Dyson; just so that it can do the very basic task of cleaning a carpet!After doing everything as instructed (still with the Dyson person on the phone), the vacuum STILL made grinding noises on any room carpet I tried. The only time it did not grind was when I vacuumed a small tile area near our front door.After hearing over the phone that the Dyson was still grinding, the Dyson person said it must be a defective DC33; & to exchange it where I purchased it.Instead, I returned it & got a refund. (Wait...there is more...)Six months later, my Wife purchased another Dyson DC33 (from a different retailer). She felt that the problems we had with the first one was all due to a defective unit.....I hoped so as well......we were both about to have our hopes shattered...The new Dyson DC33 did EXACTLY the same grinding (right out of the box) as the first one we had purchased 6 months prior did!Again, I called Dyson & was brought along the same gasket removal procedure I was brought through with the first DC33 we had.Again, it did nothing to stop the problem.Again, I was told it was 'odd' but we must have a defective unit; & to exchange it where we purchased it.We brought the DC33 back to were it was purchased.When we walked in with it, we told a salesperson we were having a problem with it. The salesperson kind of twisted his face & said with a crooked half smile 'Let me guess.....its grinding...right?' We both started laughing & said almost at the exact same time 'YES!!'He said he has had ALLOT of people bring them back for the grinding problem.He was very nice & wanted to hear for himself what the grinding sounded like. He plugged in the DC33 & turned it on. It worked fine on tile & vinyl flooring samples he had; but as soon as it went onto ANY type of rug, the grinding noise was insane. He had many flooring samples for testing vacuums; & the DC33 made grinding noises on ALL of them except a wood, vinyl, & tile sample.We wanted to return our second defective DC33 & get another refund; but since the box was accidentally thrown away (UGH!) we were unable to return it. (Side note: It is nobody's fault but OUR OWN on the thrown away box / no refund issue!)The Dyson DC33 is by far the WORST vacuum we have ever purchased.Just do a simply web search for 'Dyson DC33 Grinding' & you will spend the rest of the day & night reading nightmare after nightmare about the DC33 grinding.There is obviously a design flaw with this unit that cannot be denied....except by Dyson.To have Dyson Customer Service instruct its customers to take parts out of their units to reduce suction in order to stop a grinding problem that should not be happening in the first place, is absolutely unbelievable & ridiculous.At least the yellow color of the DC33 is perfect for it, since it's a lemon!If you are unfortunate enough to purchase a DC33, DO NOT THROW THE BOX AWAY!

When trying to remove the carpet fibers from the roller brush I broke the roller brush drive belt.I thought OK so I'll order a replacement from Dyson. After calling Dyson customer service they told me the belt was not available and directed me to an aftermarket source. The belt was purchased for minimal cost - that was the easy part. Most people will not be able to change the drive belt.You need an 6 inch No. 15 Torx wrench to take the unit apart. I found a Youtube video for another dyson model which helped me understand the disassembly. All this information should be posted on the Dyson web site if they really wanted to provided customer support. The video helped me understand which parts could be unsnapped without breaking. The disassembly was horrible. I was sure I was going to break the plastic prying on it. The entire clutch had to be removed from the unit and disassembled to get the belt off and new belt installed. When you take the clutch off you need a special tool to remove a very small C-clamp on the clutch shaft. Do the disassembly of the clutch over a towel or the 3 small ball bearing will go bouncing away. This is a three-handed job and takes a couple of hours for someone doing it for the first time. The clutch was not easy to reassemble due to small parts that don't stay in place. After reassembly the brushes are engaged all the time and can't disengage for the hard floor switch option. Probably some small part in the clutch moved out of place during reassembly.  People it should not be this difficult to change a belt. I've also owned the hoover brand in the past which performed well and was very simple to service. This will be my last Dyson purchase. Performance is great on the unit and it is easy to use. But if the drive belt on the roller brush breaks I would throw it out. This purchase has been disappointing and a waste of money. I expected to get a least 5 years out of this unit before having any trouble.After seeing so many positive reviews on this product I suspect Dyson company are posting many of the reviews."

Eight months into our purchase, we can now give our personal view.First and foremost it's a vacuum without peer.  Amazing suction!  before we purchased the Dyson DC 33 we investigated  many name brand vacuums and thru a lending policy with a store here in town, were able to take a few vacuums back to the house for actual 'real world' tests.  Brands you see everyday and some brands that are European brands not normally found in your local stores.If you have back problems, this is NOT for you.  The power and suction will give your back and upper torso a good workout.  I am over 6 foot tall and weigh 205 pounds and by the time I'm finished with 3 rooms of carpet and a kitchen/ dining area with vinyl flooring I will break sweat every time.  (the house is under 1500sq ft)It really picks up the dirt and dust like no other machine we've ever owned.  There is a floor attachment that you can purchase for you vinyl flooring that I would highly recommend ( easier to get under and around the low spaces).There is a small 'door' on the bottom right hand side of the machine  ( that no one tells you about) that can be opened for a  lower suction setting which is ideal for curtains and or a light scatter rug, otherwise the normal high setting will be fine for the the floors and upholstery.I purchased this machine as a re-furbished model and have never been happier with the results.  (The extra long cord was also a plus)The product looks fragile (all plastic parts) but it can take a pounding. Emptying the machine is a breeze ( I suggest you purchase a 1' paint brush to get the dirt residue that attaches itself to the upper portions of the canister and will not come out without a little coaxing)Over all I am more than pleased with this purchase."

I was skeptical about the abilities of the dyson and all the hype.  my mother in law has a dyson dc 27 or something that she has had for 4 years.  she recently had a problem with the dyson making a noise, but continued to work properly.  she called dyson, they listened to the noise over the phone, sent her a box to ship it in, she shipped it off and it was back in a week working wonderfully with no noise.  this ease in service prompted me to finally make the purchase.  I have owned many, many, many cleaners in the past from kirby, shark, hoover, bissel, almost every one on the market.  I would replace my vacuum at least yearly and until dyson, found the hoover windtunnel to perform the best.  When I received my dyson, i wanted to test it out.  I immediately put the dyson together (very easy), vacuumed my small livingroom with the hoover (not even 6 months old) and then immediately vacuumed with the dyson.  I had over 1 1/2 inches of stuff in the dyson even after vacuuming with the hoover. I immediately called my daughter to come pick up her new vacuum, the hoover of course, as this was still an upgrade for her.  The dyson is the only vacuum I have ever owned that does an amazing job on my bare floors as well, it picks up everything and you can feel the difference when walking barefoot.  The price seems a little steep for the dyson, but I paid about $200.00 for my windtunnel anyway and with the dyson waranty and ease of service it is a great deal.  To me there is no comparrison.  I will never own another brand of vacuum cleaner.  I hope dyson creates a steam mop next!!!!  All I can say is if you've been on the fence about buying one, JUST DO IT!!"

I also have another dog and 2 cats. So my vacuums get a work out. I end up buying a new machine every two years. Honestly I could have bought several Dyson's by now. I just couldnt bring myself to pay the big bucks for one. My friend has a Dyson and so does my sister n law. They both swear its the best machine ever. The last vacuum I bought was a year and half ago. Its a Hoover but I cant remember the specific model, it has done a really great job. That being said though, the switch on it is going. I press it on, it starts and shuts off and starts again. Not good. I spend about 180 dollars on it and had hopes it would last me a while. I am very good on maintenance and take care of my stuff but like I said I really use a vacuum. So after getting some coupons and other incentives I decided to take the plunge and buy a Dyson. I have had it a couple of days now and my thoughts are...Meh.I have read all the stories of how people vacuum with their old machine and then use the Dyson and are gleefully mortified to see all the dirt the Dyson picked up. I did my own test. Apparently my Hoover still has great sucking power because the Dyson didn't pick up a whole lot of dirt after using my Hoover. Sure it did pick up some more hair that the Hoover missed but I wasn't blown away by the amount of dirt in the canister. The obvious benefits to me are that it didnt take me a while to put it together. Didn't even need to break out a screwdriver. That was awesome. Just click and click and it was put together. The cord is much longer than my Hoover and the quality of the rubber is better where its not going to take me a month to get the kinks and stiffness out. It is also considerably quieter and lighter than my Hoover. Pushing it is easy and I like that. I do like how the canister empties. Its simple and easy but I did notice and hair will wrap around the filter inside the canister so not touching the dirt at all is not going to happen. I can live with this, one of the joys of owning a dog. I have asked around and was told there isn't much difference between the animal version and this one except for an extra attachment. I hope that is true so I opted for this one and saved myself a hundred dollars.The wand is not really my favorite feature. It is awkward to use and i agree with others that close up jobs require some finesse. I miss my Hoover in this regard. The Dyson does seem to have a much more powerful suction though and I do see a big difference between using the Hoover attachment vs the Dyson. The Dyson definitely wins in this regard especially on stairs, its just awkward and something I will have to get used to. I do hope I get more than a year or two out of this. If I don't then the machine is definitely hype. Time will tell I guess."

This vacuum is very difficult to push on my carpeting.  I called Dyson customer service.  I was instructed to remove the plate from over the brush and then put it back on.  That seems to work great for a few days.  Also, using the wand extension is a pain.  I had high hopes for this vacuum since it's twice as expensive as vacuums I've bought before.  I am very disappointed and am sorry I made this purchase.  If I still had the packaging I would certainly return it.  My suggestion to you - buy something else."

We don't have pets, but, we have our 5 year old grand-daughter living with us, so we want everything super clean.When we moved into this house there was some sort of unknown, crumbly caked-in stuff in the hallway, between two bedrooms. I think it was from a contractor using drywall as it looked white, like cement. I took everything I could think of when we first moved in to get it off of the carpet. Well, I took this Dyson up there when I first bought it and it came up very easily! This is after using a Hoover on it for 4 years and never getting any of it up. It sounded like rocks going into the vacuum, so I think it was some sort of building material. Anyway, it's gone!We have stairs and I love using the wand for all the stairs and not having to lug the vacuum up and down. That's SO AWESOME!I do not like that I cannot reach under the cabinets with the vacuum unless I use the wand, but, I still get everything clean. I don't like having to wind the cord up each time. I got spoiled with my Hoover having an auto rewind and having a light on the front. Those are the two things I miss, but, that's it. Dyson beats Hoover hands down for cleaning!I'm very happy with how it cleans the baseboards as well. I also really like having a switch for bare floors and carpet. That's really awesome.All in all, I can say that when I need to replace my Dyson, I will replace it with another Dyson. I'll also recommend a Dyson to anyone looking for a new vacuum cleaner.

The brush locks in on my carpet when being pushed forward and won't budge unless I tilt the handle down to about 5 inches off the floor.  When I pull it towards me it works like a charm.  This type of use is not realistic (bending over to touch my toes with my vacuum everytime I go forward).

I don't have animals anymore, which is why I opted for this model.  I was little nervous about by a used product, but saved $100 and it was pretty much brand new. Still in the plastic and everything.  The only complaint that I have about these Dysons is the extend handle in which you attach the attachments.  Its long which is great for reaching the ceiling, but its not easy to maneuver for the floor or in tight spaces.

We had a similar style vac made by another company and we've used it for several years and after the point that it would no longer pick up anything (not that it picked up much to begin with), so we decided we needed to get a new one. I had been wanting to try a Dyson for years - but was always hesitant to spend the money. Let's face it - these babies are expensive! But I finally bit the bullet and bought my vac at my local Sam's Club, vice Amazon only because they happened to have a sale on them.After taking it out of the box and getting it assembled, which I found to be a challenge even with the pictures only manual, I plugged it in and started it up. Boy was I surprised at how much this vac picked up!We vacuum weekly in our house - simply because we work full-time and also started a side business. We have an English Bulldog that has short 2 inch hairs that tend to stick to everything... The shape of the hair allows it to get embedded into the weave in my carpets and is an absolute disaster to get out. For that matter, we have a low profile area run that was just FULL of hair - hair that the other vac was unable to get out. With TWO passes of this Dyson, ALL of the hair in the carpet was removed and the carpet looked new again!!!As we hit all the area rugs in our home we found that this vac sucked up more dirt and hair that we could have ever imagined was in our rugs. ALL of our rugs look BRAND NEW again and I feel confident having people over now, knowing that the floors are really clean.And because of the filter in the DC33, there is no vacuum smell in the air after you vacuum. I truly believe that I've slept well the past week after cleaning - simply because all that dust, dander, dog hair, and who knows what else - went out with the trash. The first time we used this vac, we emptied the container six times!!!To echo what another reviewer said about hair getting wrapped around the beater-bar... It's true... It happened, but what I found was that it was the long human hairs from the female type that tended to get wrapped up. It was a bit of a pain having to clear them off... But I think with any vac, you'll have the same issues.I cannot say enough good things about the DC33. No need to buy a Dyson made for homes with pets - because this will do the job just fine! However, I think if you went with something like the DC28 instead - that you'd have the same experience.Buy it. You will not regret it!"

The carpets look new, not even joking! This really picks up everything - we have a dog with lots of little hairs and a baby crawling around the floor. We NEEDED a good vacuum & this is great. The price was right too, we didn't pay full retail just because the box was open and did not have original packaging. I was skeptical never buying a Warehouse Deal before, but it was great. Never even been used. I would definitely recommend looking into the Warehouse Deals on Dyson vacuums & spending a little more to get a vacuum that will LAST."

I vacuum a couple times a week and this is time consuming and a huge hassle. The Dirt Devil I had previously, was horrible to dump. It would fall apart into the trash can so I would have to go digging for it getting myself dirty in the process--so more to clean.  The one we had previous to that had issues with the brush height. It kept falling to the lowest level, making the belt burn and also the 'upright' handle wouldn't stay upright. Maybe we had three 'lemons'. What are the odds.

I wasnt looking for amazing, just functional would have been nice.  They have cheapened and cut corners in every conceivable way on this model.  The worst part is that when you go to empty this new 'bottom opening' cylinder, the debris invariably ends up all over your hands.  Even if you try to just shake it out, then the red center post located inside falls out too and you have to mess with latching it back into the chamber!!!There is no way they didnt realize the inferiority of the product they were putting out in this instance, and it's really unfortunate.  By the time you have to empty a full chamber where the debris is wrapped all around that central post thingy, most consumers including me would feel like it's too dirty and used to return to the store for the rip off it is.So, I wont buy any dirt devils again... not when I have to gamble on this kind of deliberate design shoddiness so they can try to shave a few more bucks off the cost to make a vacuum.I'm taking my brand loyalty somewhere else and purchasing a vacuum that is not a complete joke."

This vacuum picks up everything, is light, and is obviously inexpensive.  If you are a person who vacuums everyday and noise is a factor, you should probably be looking in a different price range because you love vacuuming that much.  For me, I vacuum maybe once a week or so and for the 1500 square feet of my condo, this is perfect.As one other reviewer pointed out, the suction is so powerful on this and the way the action works on the bottom, it is sort of pushes itself along the carpet.

But the old vacuum had died and it was getting hard to find bags for it so, I decided to go bagless. For the price this vacuum is good and has good suction action. It is so light, I was afraid to assemble it, because I thought pushing the parts together would crack them.  It is VERY light plastic. But, easy to assemble and nothing broke -- so far, anyway. Picks up dirt very well. The only issue is, it is EXTREMELY hard to empty. I think if a person did not have pets, it would be perfect, however since I have quite a few cats and dogs, the hair it picks up gets stuck in the top of the clean-out chamber and requires that I pull out the whole &#34;guts&#34; of the device to get the packed-in hair out. Quite a mess and gets dirt all over the place. So found that it's best to do this outside. Can't simply, &#34;open the bin and dump the picked up dirt in the trash&#34; as the pretty instruction photos show. Guess it's better than having to buy bags all the time though."

It comes with just a couple of tools: a brush and a crevice tool, but how many do you actually need or use? The fact is that we clean the house with this unit effectively and efficiently.The main point is that it is powerful enough to pick up dirt. That's what you buy a vacuum for, and that's what it does. It won't sing to you or cook the rice, but it will clean your floors and upholstery. It has the basic height settings, and it's not hard to push or maneuver.The bagless feature, pretty much a standard these days, is fine. But reseating the canister after emptying it is a little tricky until you get the hang of it; it's fussier than it should be and that's the only real drawback we found with this machine (one star off; this particular aspect could easily have been better designed).It's too early to tell how truly durable the unit is going to be but it does look and feel like it's going to last for a while, as has generally been our experience with Dirt Devil products.The bottom line: a good basic machine to do good basic cleaning.

It looks, feels and smells like plastic.  Extreme Plastic!!  Assembly was really simple, with 1 screw needed to fasten the handle.  They included 3 screws, and I still don't know if the other 2 are for something else, as the directions are sparse to say the least.  But its pretty solid in its plasticness (is that even a word?!).And now onto the real review!  This is a pretty cool design, emulating the upright 'cyclonic' bagless designs of much more expensive brands, many of which we've tried.  Simply stated, suction is terrific.  It works well for sure.  And its loud!  For the price its pretty awesome.  The rotating brush in the vacuum head is highly aggressive, and it definitely gets the job done on carpet.  Its also light, really light.  It can be moved easily and quickly.In conclusion, its pretty amazing for the price.  We have some other Dirt Devil units, mostly electric brooms, and they seem to last for a while at least.

On the other hand, the plastic is pretty thin all over the vacuum and the wheels are noisy when they move. Nonetheless, all the features for a vacuum in this price range are there -- bagless canister, basic hose, washable filter, etc. Assembly consisted of three screws to put a few parts together and then installing the dirt cup.There is no height adjustment for the brush wheel and it doesn't seem to work very well on hard floors. There are only 10 amps of power, unlike some (slightly) heavier models that provide a typical 12 amp motor. The cord is sufficiently long (manufacturer states 25 feet) and the power switch is easily foot actuated. There is no headlight. The belt and brush roll replacement, however, requires five (5) screws to be removed and a bit more delicate handiwork. A one year warranty rounds the package out.My apartment has a relatively high pile carpet and this vacuum has no trouble dealing with it. The hose comes with a simple upholstery brush and well as an edge tool. The canister opens from the bottom (nice!) so just put your garbage bag/can under it and whoosh, it's empty. I haven't needed to clean the filter yet but it looks easy to do. In terms of cleaning performance, it seems to pick up everything I vacuum under it (mostly food crumbs and dust I think). No pet hair in my household so can't speak to that type of suction efficacy. In short, the performance seems similar to the 12Amp Eureka I have with more features (headlight, longer cord length, easier to replace belt, etc.)If weight, price, and performance (in that order) are the most important factors to you of a vacuum, look no further. But if any other order of preference applies to you, look elsewhere."

I'm amazed at the power and suction it has.  I've been keeping around an old Eureka Optima for years because it had a lot of hose suction and I use it to clean the carpet in my car--but I think I can finally replace it with this one.  I've never owned a vacuum with this much hose suction!  I do have a much more expensive vacuum that I use in my house--but I'll probably use this one until it breaks or something.I've used this on both my carpets and tile floor and it works extremely well.  I'm not sure how the automatic height adjuster works, but it seems to.  My carpet is a very low carpet and the power brushes on this vacuum are actually strong enough to almost self-propel the vacuum forward!  This didn't happen on the tile floor in my living room. Since I don't have thick carpet I can't comment on how it will work on that.The negative--this is the cheapest feeling vacuum I have ever owned!  I'm not sure how the plastic pieces will put up with normal usage--but I'll find out.If you want a powerful vacuum dirt cheap this seems to be it.  My advice to those who still aren't sure . . . what a few months and see if the early reviewers start complaining about it breaking apart."

Like our Hoover (and pretty much every vacuum I've owned), using the attachments for the hose results is greatly diminished suction.The Dust Devil is not perfect, but it does well for typical household tasks.

It works best on low-medium pile carpet. Its smaller, so great for apartments. Or people without large areas to clean. The biggest complaint is just that they didnt make the bin a little bigger. It fills up fairly quick. This vacuum has a lot of issues compared to something like my dyson... part of it feel very cheaply made, the bin sometimes jams, it has a tough time on very high pile carpets and hardwood floors, dog and pet hair seems to get stuck in there, and suction is not what ive come to expect... And yet, this is hands down the best vacuum for this price I have ever used. I assume formerly expensive technology is starting to trickle down but the economics or technical voodoo of it isnt really important. Its great. Its compact, its easier to tote around then a large vacuum, and will do 75% of what my dyson dc 28 does. And at this price when the cheaper parts inevitably fail it can be replaced in a couple years for something better. I cant say the same about my expensive vacuum ive invested in--that sucker will be being repaired for years to come. Highly recommended."

The assembly instructions were a little hard to follow for those of us who are mechanically challenged, but once put together it worked just as well as other cyclonic vacuums that I've used, including a Hoover and the extremely expensive ($500+) Dyson pet hair vacuum.  This, of course, made me wonder why the heck I've been paying $250+ for vacuums over the past 10 years, when this one works just as well at a fraction of the cost.  I do think the collection container is on the small side, thereby requiring more emptying during a cleaning session, but I think the Dyson has the same problem.  What this means, for example, is that if you have a lot of dirt or pet hair in the house, you may have to empty the container twice vacuuming a 200 square foot room.  For the price, however, that is something I can live with.  Good vacuum."

From the moment this Dirt Devil came out of the box and my wife began assembling it (by the way, assembly was simple--just a few minutes and 3 screws), everything about it said CHEAP.  Good luck finding a part anywhere on it that is not molded plastic.  Further, it weighs next to nothing.  For those who are looking for a light vacuum, you will like this one.  For us, it just felt cheap.  Frankly, I had all but written it off until we finally gave it a try.  THAT'S WHEN MY PERCEPTION OF THIS VACUUM MADE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.Wow, it is a real performer!  When I say it's a performer, I am obviously referring to its ability to extract dirt and debris from surfaces of all types.  We have tried it on tile, laminate, and carpet flooring, and it has done fabulously on all surfaces, with no height adjustment required, I might add.  One of the nifty features of the vacuum is the fact that it auto-adjusts to the height of the surface being vacuumed.  I have NO IDEA how it does this (engineering is not my forte), but it works.  That much I will attest.  I can tell it is working well because you can see, hear, and feel its power.  When I say you can see its power, there is something reassuring about seeing the dirt collection receptacle on the vacuum swirling around with dirt that has been collected.  We were truly amazed at how well it works.  The detachable hose and attachments work well, too, and they attach/detach easily.  No complaints there.  The dirt collection receptacle attaches and detaches smoothly and easily.  We tried opening up the receptacle to see how we will empty it when it gets full.  Again, it was simple.  Should be a snap.We look forward to putting this vacuum to the test.  My only concern gets back to where I started.  It just seems too cheaply made.  I can see it getting tipped over and breaking on a hard floor.  From there, we will have a worthless piece of junk, as nobody wants to use a broken vacuum.  I feel like they should have built this kind of quality performance into a better made vacuum.  I guess this is the way of the world now in our 'throw away' society.  I remember the days of vacuums getting passed down from one generation to the next.  That ain't happening with this vacuum.  It give it 3 years max before it meets the trash barrel.Still, I give this vacuum 4 stars because it works great.  If you baby it and handle it like fine China, it may last you many years.  For the price, it's hard to complain."

This is my first cyclonic vacuum and I am very pleased with it. I've been using a Hoover Tempo for 4 years, it's worked well. I vacuumed the carpeting before this new Dirt Devil arrived, so I felt it was already fairly clean. New vacuum arrived yesterday and I went over carpeting again with this new one. I was very surprised to see how much it picked up. Clumps of matter which you can see in the plastic container, then empty in the garage. Based on what I see this is the best vacuum I've ever had. So I give it 5 stars and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. It's very lightweight (13.8 lbs. shipping weight) and easy to use. Who knew vacuums do not need to be big & heavy?!. I do feel the assembly directions were weak, however. There was no quick assembly sheet included, the booklet had very small print in 3 languages printed one after another. Dirt Devil (made by Royal, in Ohio) would do new users a big favor if they would include a larger print easy assembly guide in all new boxes. It's lightweight, easy to use, picks up quite a bit, very fair price, and highly recommended."

I have a 2 bed, 2 bath apt. with 2 cats and a large dog, so I have to empty the container a couple times each room. This would be a lot better for an apartment without pets, but in the end it works really well and cleans great, so it doesn't really bother me to empty it often. The suction is pretty amazing, my roommates GF has the original DD Breeze (12 amp, non cyclonic) and this really does a better job, pushes easier, and cleans up more dirt even while only having a 10 amp motor. The tools are simple but work fine as well and the hose connects simply and sturdily.All in all its a great cheap vacuum, I would spend a bit more if I could do it over again and get a heavier duty and larger dirt container vacuum instead. That all said, if you are debating between the ~$50 vacuums, this is probably the one to get as its the latest tech, and genuinely works great."

In fact, after using my best tools and handle grippers the handle is still not completely seated.

I would highly reccomend this unit. it's low profile is a plus as well. you can pay for the name of dyson, but physics are the same....the process of creating the amount of suction is produced by the power and speed of the suction... go ahead and pay the money if you have it for the dyson name... but you will not find that machine any better than this. the key to a vaccuum is to actually use it regularly. if you wait six months and expect it to clean your house and when the filter gets clogged and doesn't work well, well then you are mistaken... there are many good vaccuums on the market , this is definitely one of them...

The design flaws are evident if you have ever owned a Dyson. I think the cord is too long and gets in the way but am probably one of a few.  I find the height adjustment doesn't always change. A power cycle fixes this but it is annoying.  I think the canister dump buttons are cheaply made and on the wrong side. They have held up so far so we will see. I hate having to remove the cylinder in the middle I'd the canister to remove dog hair each dump. It's is a serious design flaw. The largest flaw is the wand/ attachments. The tube is too short. In order to reach anything it needs to be right beside you. That doesn't work well for stairs.  I wish it would come with a rotary brush. I purchased a hoover one separately, but it is worthless.

It is now July and it keeps breaking on me.  I am unable to return the item so I have to spend time and gas money taking it to & from the repair shop.  Thankfully it is still under warranty.I should have returned it when I first felt 'disappointed'.  It doesn't accept attachments which was a minor dissappointment in the beginning. The cleaning wand is pretty short which makes it hard to clean the base boards around the house without bending over and makes it difficult to reach those high places as well. The canister has to be emptied often and is very messy as others have stated in their reviews.  We have some carpet, tile and hardwood floors which require switching gears.  Although that is easily done with the push of a button, it doesn't always switch gears like it should.  The wheels do not turn/roll very well and they make a squeaky noise once in awhile.  It doesn't vacuum 'throw' rugs, small bathroom rugs or kitchen rugs very well either.  The machine has always felt 'cheaply' made, but looks good. Anyways, I really wish I would have returned it earlier.  I was really trying to make it work and was hopeful especially since it had so many great reviews. I had a Dyson for 8 years and had no problems with it. I was looking for a new vacuum because I dropped the Dyson canister and broke it...My Dyson still works, so I probably should have just bought a new canister instead of the Hoover.  I am so disappointed.Don't rely on all of the good reviews. If you do purchase this machine, and notice anything that doesn't seem right, take it back right away!  Check with your friends to see what vacuum cleaners they use.  Unfortunately, my sister has a Dyson, my neighbors machines have also been breaking, and others didn't have any good reports for me.

The dust filter seems like it needs to be cleaned more than every two months.Having said all this, if I had to do it over again I would have purchased a Dyson Ball vacuum. Mainly out of principle. Dyson developed the technology first and Hoover actually tried to buy the patent to it could take it off the market. Dyson has a longer reaching hose and the ball technology makes the vacuum extremely maneuverable, and this vacuum struggles to maneuver at times.Still a great vacuum especially for the price. I paid just over $190 on Amazon and I think it was originally in the $400 range."

The canister is SUPER easy to clean, cord is extra long, blue LEDs let you know what carpet setting you are on, and lights up the power button.

This cleaner in my opinion, is as good as, or better than the Dyson, at a fraction of the cost.I was trying to stay away from a bagless because I feared dust escaping every time the canister is emptied, but I was drawn by not needing to buy bags anymore, and the washable filter.  The canister opens from the bottom for emptying, so when emptied in a 13 gallon trash can, I don't have dust flying all over the place.I was torn between the Shark Navigator and Dyson DC25 Animal.  The Hoover Platinum is a bit heavier than I originally wanted, but by comparison, it makes the others look like toys.I agree with the other reviews that the hose seems shorter, but that is because it doesn't have an extension wand. On the plus side, it does stretch sufficiently without the vacuum tipping over.The DirtFinder system is AMAZING.  I keep testing it every time by going back to a room I've already cleaned, and the CLEAN green light stays on!I didn't want to spend so much on a vacuum, but after researching and trying various products, I couldn't afford not to.  I LOVE this cleaner."

It does a wonderful job of picking up dirt and pet hair... if you can keep it running.  The first day I used it, it ran for about 15 minutes and then shut itself off.  I turned it on again and after a couple of minutes, it shut itself off again.  It continued to do this until I gave up turning it on and having it go off again.  It just wouldn't run.  I looked up info on the Internet and there are some other reviewers who have had this problem.  I guess I just got a lemon.  I took it back the next day... the darn thing just wouldn't run."
"378","XX","B001PB51GQ","4.0","March 28, 2010","A30T16MDD8CYE3","This is a great vacuum.","I purchased this vacuum after retiring our 20 year old Panasonic upright.  I had read many of the various reviews written about this vacuum and have always been skeptical of bagless vacuums but decided to give this vacuum a try after looking at it in a discount shopping center.  (Next to the broken Dyson vacs on display)Our family of 6 has two large dogs, a cat and several birds so needless to say vacuuming is a must daily.  We were going through vacuum bags in our Panasonic about 1 every 10 days to 2 weeks so the bagless feature was a big seller for us and this bagless vacuum works great.There is no odor at any time while running this vacuum (you could always tell when the bags were getting full on our old vacuum because the discharge air would have pet odors) and no dust.  The Hepa filter does a great job of cleaning the air.  This vacuum has a total of 3 filters on it.  We take the dirt collector outside to the trash bin to empty becuase it is indeed a messy task and hard to complete inside without creating a mess, so for those of you who don't have the convenience of being able to dump this outside you might want to reconsider.  You also need to read the owners manual closely about emptying the dirt collector as there is a filter screen (Hoover calls it an Umbrella Tube) which can clog up before the dirt cup is completely full if you tend to pick up a lot of hair or larger debris.  If this clogs up it will reduce the suction of the vacuum considerably.  Hoover recommends you clean this monthly but we usually clean this screen everytime we dump the dirt collector as it is very simple to do.This vacuum has great suction and does a great job of cleaning.  The dirty floor sensor works great and we have found that the heavy traffic areas of our carpeted floors took a little extra effort to get clean the first time over with the new vacuum but it did the job.  I would put this vacuum up against any Dyson vac out there and I believe it is built better because I looked over a lot of vacuums before we bought this one and it looks and feels sturdy.  It is a bit bulky compared to other uprights but that goes back to it's sturdy build.  It has an adjustable height control at your finger tips wich is nice and a feature that shuts the brush roller off when the vacuum is in the full upgright position.  I suppose it would have been nice to have a self-propelled feature on this vacuum for the ladies as it is a little hard to push around on plush carpets becuase of the excellent suction.  But as I see it that is just one more thing to break down, so if you can live with a vacuum that is a bit heavy and bulky you will still love this vacuum.I ready several complaints about the Hoover vacuum hoses being too short.  The hose on this vacuum is just as long or longer than our old vacuum but it is much more flexible so when you connect the hose attachments to it it wants to pull back on the hose naturally becuase of the high suction. You really have to pull on this hose if you want to take advantage of its full length capability which makes it pretty tuff to clean up high or all the way up and down the stairs without moving it a couple of times.  An obvious remedy is to work from the top half way down and from the bottom half way up.Overall I think this is a great vacuum and would have given it 5 stars but then there are a few things that could make it better.  Like I said I looked at a lot of vacuums out there (and believe me there is no perfect vacuum) before I purchased this one and I believe this vacuum delivers the best value for my money.  The true test will be to see how it holds up over time.  If it lasts 20 years like our old vacuum I would say it was a steal for the price.  (We purchsed this on an Amazon special price of under $280.)"

If the vacuum is too hard to push then you have the carpet height setting wrong.I love how the canister opens from the bottom to empty!  No more turning over a canister to empty and having dirt come out the little input hole.Some have also complained about not having enough attachments, it has the two I need and it doesn't bother me that it doesn't have the standard 2 extension wands as the hose is rugged and stretches far!  I can stand on the ground and clean my ceiling fans and cobwebs out of the corners on the ceiling, so to me it's got plenty of reach.  (I'm 5'9' for anyone who cares).The suction on this vacuum is incredible, which is what makes it critical you don't set the carpet height too low... if you do the thing sucks to the ground and is harder to push.  I find I have the carpet height setting about one setting up from my other Hoover.Having the carpet height adjuster on the handle is bliss.... no more bending over to change the setting when you move from room to room with different flooring.I would (and already have) recommended this vacuum to others."

I was torn between this and one of those pricier vacuums with the ball. I am so happy with my purchase. I agree with the other 5 star reviews that this vacuum doesn't get everything at the edges, but that's why there's attachments. The suction is so strong that I could lift my carpet with the hose. The amount of dirt this thing gets up is unbelieveable! I had to go over my carpets several times to get the 'dirty' indicator to go off, but when all the dirt finally came out, it switched to 'clean'. It's embarassing to admit, but I got over a pound of dirt out of my living room carpet! I guess you really don't know what's in your carpets until you have a quality vacuum. I recommend emptying this outside because of all the dust and fine particles.

Not a hard task!  The old Hoover had run it's course and was basically worn out.  After reading lots of reviews for different brands and models, I bought another Hoover.I'm very satisfied. It has a lot of cleaning power and has features I really like:  Height settings (controlled by an electric switch on the upper handle) which lower and raise the cleaning unit to accommodate different cleaning needs.  The first of four settings (the highest) is great for hardwood and tile floors which I have a lot of.  The brushes do not rotate on this setting - just suction which appears to do the job well.  The 2nd through 4th height settings result in lowering the unit closer to the floor and start the brushes rotating to brush the carpet as it cleans.  For the carpeted area of my house, I've never had to go beyond the second of the four height settings.I love the 'Dirty/Clean' light which seems pretty accurate in determining what areas are clean and which aren't.  Kind of fun watching it turn 'Clean' after cleaning a section.Also, the 'bagless' unit makes it easier to toss the dirt from the easily removed dirt container which snaps out for an easy trip to the trash can.  I'm always amazed how much debris and dust gets captured during my twice a month cleanings.  Okay, maybe this is not the cleanest house on the block but it's still nice to see the dirt disappear when I do clean. The unit is a bit bulky but the rollers are useful for maneuvering it about.All in all, this vacuum sucks! (In a good way!)"

My comparisons were Dyson and Meile, which are way out of my price range!  I have a two bedroom apartment (approx 1200 sq ft) two kids and a small dog.  I buy a vacuum about every six months.  I wanted something that was going to last and keep working!!!  I think I'm going to be very happy with this vacuum.  Price was right on Amazon ($250ish). Assembly was very easy.  Two screws to attach the handle to the unit and I was ready to go!  The suction is amazing!!!  I wanted to address some of the complaints that I've seen on many boards....  The dirt cup IS hard to close.  But just hold down the button you pressed to open it and it will catch the latch.  Stop trying to slam it shut!!  I was able to figure it out and my hands did not get dirty!! The only time my hands did get dirty was emptying the cyclonic cone.  No big deal.  I expect that when I have a bagless unit.  I'm not sure how sophisticated dumping dirt can be...realistic expectations people!!!  I suspect that regular vacuuming with this unit will cut down on the number of times I have to empty it...as its first use was excessive because it was picking up after a far inferior vacuum.  I also read about the hose being too short.  Again, realistic expectations...I gave it a good stretch before using it and I was able to reach the ceiling....what more do you want?  I see they sell an attachment....  And for this thing not being self propelled (and I will admit, I've never owned one) it sure did jump right into action when I turned it on! I saw some complaints that it was hard to push.  Adjust the floor setting to a higher level.  Problem solved. A six year warrantee is nice too...that says to me that they stand behind the workmanship and don't expect anything to break...and if it does they will fix it!  SIX YEARS!!

I don't have experience with longevity of this vacuum since I just purchased it here at Amazon.I can say the vacuum has picked up such fine particles of dirt my older vacuum missed that I was astonished at what my vacuum was not picking up.I like this vac as I can turn off the beater bar. I have some Shaw carpet that requires NO beater bar when cleaning it. Sounds strange I know, some carpet sellers don't even know that they are selling carpet which requires suction only and cleaning 2 times a week.The vacuum is a little heavy but not any heavier than my canister vac.The cord is SUPER long.You do have to hand wind the cord up, not the best feature.I found the dirt finder display to work properly and well.Putting my hand or a large paper over the bottom of the vacuum I found the suction to be not so good. However when I start to vacuum a low profile area rug the suction is so incredible I can't hardly even push the vacuum over the carpet.This can be good and bad. You have to really push it.I don't have this problem on our other carpet. I think it is because the area rug is on a hard wood floor and the suction is making a tight seal through the rug and on the hardwood floor.Overall I am happy with this purchase.I hope the vac lasts a very long time.One thing I do wish it came with was a attachment with a rolling brush to remove hair from furniture."

The upholstery tool has a little clip so you can remove the brushes,  this clip broke last week but i think you can get a whole new tool from Hoover for under 4$.  I just used a strong glue to reattach the brushes.  2.  The area with the end of the cyclone tubes has dust in it and it makes the vacuum look dirty even when its been emptied?  Not sure if dirt was supposed to get into that area but it just cosmetic and doesn't affect the oeration, just looks bad.

I really like this vacuum and it's proven to be very efficient.  The only slight complaint I have is Hoover's customer service.  When the vacuum arrived, it was missing the screws that hold it together.  Even though I ordered this product from Amazon, I called Hoover's customer service to resolve the situation.

So glad I settled on this one! Very powerful vacuum. I was shocked at how much stuff it pulled out of the carpet and off floors that my old Hoover had been leaving behind. Also love that this one doesn't kick back dirt on the floors like my other Hoover did. It works fantasticly on both carpet and on wood floors and ceramic tile.One of the things I LOVE which made me choose this over the Dyson is the raising and lowering of the vacuum is on the handle of the vacuum. I HATED bending over with my old Hoover to move the dial from bare floors to high carpet. Such a pain. With this Hoover Platinum, I do it with a touch of the button and don't have to bend over. This is a huge plus because I have carpet in the bedrooms, wood floors in the living area and ceramic tile in the kitchen, hallways and bathrooms. I was constantly having to bend over to raise/lower as I went room to room. No more with this one! Also love that it has a really long cord so I can do three rooms without unplugging. This vacuum is also narrower than my older Hoover so it fits into smaller spaces better.I have three minor complaints: Yes, the attachment hose is too short. But I knew this when I decided to buy it. Hoover really needs to look at increasing the length on future models. I was also surprised to find that the vacuum is made of a cheaper plastic than I had imagined for a vacuum at this price. But I bought it to clean, not for a beauty contest, so it does the job well. Like some other reviewers mentioned, the DIRTY/CLEAN sensor is really unnecessary. You know just by sight and sound that the floor is already clean when the CLEAN comes up.As other reviewers mentioned, this is a heavy vacuum. I also knew that when buying it. But I would choose the heavier vacuum with the raise/lower feature than a lighter Dyson without it.Very satisfied with my purchase overall and know I'll get years of use from it as I have with other Hoover products."

I was skeptical until I got it.  Now, count me in.  I did a test when I first got it.  I vacuumed the upstairs with our 15+ year old cheapo vacuum, then after it was 'clean', I did it again with the Hoover.  I think I emptied the dirt cup 3-4 times!!!  I was simultaneously amazed and disgusted at all the dirt that had been there.  Granted, a lot of it was loose carpet fibers, but also quite a bit of very fine powder.This is a powerful vacuum.  It's main job is to remove dirt from carpet.  It does this job exceptionally well.  The 'Dirty' indicator is a bonus, and it is not a gimmick.  It consistently lights up right in the heavy-traffic spots I'd expect it to.  And the long cord is great.  For this main cleaning job, the vacuum was worth it.There are some things that this product does not do exceptionally well.* It does an OK job on bare floors.* Edge cleaning is pretty much non-existent.  You'll need to grab the attachment hose for a quick run around the edges.* Stair cleaning is awkward.  This is not a lightweight, agile vacuum you can carry around with you as you vacuum the stairs.  You need to park the machine on a flat floor or landing and use the hose attachment for stair cleaning.  This is sometimes difficult with tall stair runs.I don't agree with other reviews that the hose doesn't reach above shoulder height -- but it is a coiled hose.  To get more length, you need to twist the hose.  Also, I thought the manual was pretty clear about how to empty the center cup, and it is easy to do.So, if you want a powerful machine that does a great job at cleaning carpet, this product is a great choice.  Realize it takes a hefty motor to get that, and you won't find a vacuum that is both as powerful as this, yet lightweight and agile."

I have to say, if Costco didn't have the greatest return policy, I don't think I could have given Hoover another chance.  I gave this vacuum a chance, and I am glad I did.  This vacuum sucked so much dirt and debris out of our carpets, I could not believe it.  I heard all of the rave reviews of Dyson and almost went with one, but then my next door neighbor's Dyson got clogged and they spent hours trying to fix it.  I didn't feel like bothering with all of the hassle, so I looked towards this vacuum.  It really does an amazing job sucking everything out of the carpets.  The height adjustments are on the handle, and that makes switching between carpets, hardwood floors, and rugs a breeze; no more bending over and fighting the switch to cooperate on the base of the vacuum.  The DirtFinder may seem like a gimmick, but it really is useful.  The one thing that I can see being a problem for some people, is that the wand is not telescoping, neither does the vacuum have extension wands.  It is just the one foot long aluminum wand, plus the fairly long hose.  Since the aluminum wand can be easily removed with the press of a button, Hoover could sell a separate telescoping wand separately, maybe that is their plan; but that is the only thing I can find that I am not pleased about.  Other than that, this is a terrific vacuum, that will help make our home a cleaner one.  You cannot go wrong with this vacuum."

After doing a lot of research on this, Comsumer Digest's, and Best Buy's sites, we went with this one.  Assembly was quite simple, requiring only a Phillips head screwdriver for two screws, before it was set up.  Our first use, just after vacuuming an area done with the old vacuum, left me stunned.  The clear reservoir/ 'bag?' area filled with lint, dirt, dust, hair and fibers, and left me uneasy about leaving any other carpets un-done.  Part of this vacuum's appeal comes in the form of the sensor that lights up as 'dirty' or 'clean' as it detects the amount of material being sucked up.  It never seems to be wrong, taking me into the more heavily-trafficked areas and requiring a little extra time to get it all sucked up just right.While some have complained about the length of the attachment hose, it does stretch pretty well, which allows me to hit everywhere I need in my one-floor home.  The bright LED light in the front illuminates the carpet much better than our old vacuum, insuring that tiny Lego parts are saved and crying children are therefore avoided.  The hose 'attachment' has a much sturdier construction than our older vacuum, and will seemingly take a lot more abuse before it should have any problems.  Two additional hose attachemtns are provided, a crevice tool and a wider head, which should help most tackle their needs.Overall, the story on this vacuum is that it is well worth the price, and will leave you appalled at what you used to accept as a standard of cleanliness.  My wife has commented that the air in the house seems cleaner/ clearer, and I definitely notice an improvement in the feel of our carpets walking around in bare feet.

But it could use a little extra thought in the design of the hose.  The hose is very short.  It doesn't extend enough to reach all the steps in my entrance hall or my basement.  There is no extention piece either nor does the wand telescope to be longer.  And the little attachment that comes with it is hard to manuver without the brush on it.  It gets hung up in the carpet and is pretty small.  A turbo brush attachment should have been included to allow a more thourough cleaning job on stairs and upholstery.  I would have thought a company like Hoover who has been around for years would have thought out and designed the perfect vacuum by now but this one falls short.  It's great for normal vacuuming of carpets and hard floors but forget using it for the rest.  I am leaning toward returning it for a refund and looking for something better.  Also see my review on the Electrolux Versatility.  My search continues."

Let me start with the great part, More suction then any other vacuum we have ever owned.  Brought out more dirt and dust then any vacuum we have ever owned.  The dirt sensor is awesome, works just like described, usually by our doorways is the dirtiest and the sensor proves that.  Now for the bad. Size!!!!!! Too big, will not fit under our beds like all our other models that we have owned, even when you put it at the lowest setting it still will not fit.  The extension is NOT long enough to do any vacuuming above shoulder height.  Would love to give it a  5 star ratings, but the two items that I mentioned are too important not to mark it down a star for each one.  Would I buy it again? No, for the two reasons I mentioned, but Man the areas it does reach... Wow, what suction!!!"
"404","XX","B001PB51GQ","4.0","May 11, 2009","A1DK0NVHROMIQO","Good But with issues","I just purchased this vacuum so this is from the perspective of the first 48 hours.  I read quite a bit about different versions looking for a HEPA filter bagless model.  In the end, the choice was between this unit and a DYSON 14.  The DYSON had many more positive reviews and, to me, was considered the standard.  However, I do not plan to use the vacumm often so I let my wife may the final decision.  She handled both vacuums and selected this unit.  As I understand it, she selected this one because of the conventional look as well as the perception that the Hoover will go under some furniture and will clean baseboards.  The DYSON will not.A small glitch occurred when we got the unit home.  There are only two screws to finish the vacuum and Hoover forgot to include them.  So, I had to drive a 1hr round trip to obtain the screws. Thanks Hoover.Back home, the vacuum went together and we tested it in areas where we typically vacuum with our old sears craftsman model.  In all areas, lots of dirt and carpet lint were recovered.  Inspecting the debris both then and after another repeat indicates that most of what is picked up is carpet lint.  The beater brushes appear to work carpet hard.The dirty/clean indicator is sonic based.  From what I see, if anything is 'seen' in the airstream, the light is red.  This means that carpet lint triggers the dirty indication as well.  This seems to work but repeats over the same patch of 'clean' carpet will likely have reoccurrences of 'dirty'.  I think we are going to think in terms of average rather than looking too closely at the light.What I notice is that the extension wand is short as in very short.  The DYSON, though difficult to get on and off, was better in this regard.  One good thing about the vacuum is that the brushes turn off when the vacuum is on and upright.  This is something that the craftsman didn't do.I gave this unit 4 stars for the completely useless canister bottom lid clip. The canister comes off perfectly.  It dumps easily but not as easliy as the DYSON. Closing the bottom cover is a pain.  The manual says 'press firmly'.  Yeah, a gorilla could press firmly but everyone else is going to try banging or slamming the lid close.  This is not good long-term.  I eventually showed my wife that by pressing the release button again, you can actually close the bottom without risking damage to the unit or your hand.  Unfortunately, this will get both hands completely dusty.  This is a complete failure by Hoover.  If anyone can simply press down and get this to close I would like to know how.  I have to wonder if the engineer even tried this contraption.One last item is noise.  This unit is quiet.  It is quieter than the DYSON or our old craftsman.  Both my wife and I commented on this.In the end, this vacuum appears better than older models.  It appears to be sturdier than the DYSON.  This unit has three filters all of which are permanent (cyclone, primary, hepa). This is what I was looking for and expect it not to disappoint.Here's to hope....."

I was very hesitant to pay about $450 for a vacuum, but I was tired of buying a new vacuum about every 2 years because I did not want to pay more than $100 for a vacuum cleaner.I was not disappointed.  I have a dog that sheds, and I have longer hair, and I shed a lot too, and find that this vacuum picks up very well.  I could not believe how clean my rugs looked after using this vacuum on them; I did not realize just how dirty they were.Also, the controls are very intuitive, and the vacuum was very easy to assemble.I agree with the one user who mentioned the awkward way of emptying the vacuum when it's full, but it is by no means a deal breaker.Between the performance and the 6 year limited warranty, I highly recommend this product.  I wanted to give it 4.5 stars because the awkward way of emptying the vacuum, but since I could not, I rounded up because I really like this vacuum."
"406","XX","B001PB51GQ","4.0","March 23, 2009","A3C0O4FLPL5AN7","Good, but a few things you need to know","We went through our second Dyson, and decided to switch just for the sake of doing so.  Aside from the really high end European models, we opted for this new 'prestige' line from Hoover, figuring it would be interesting to see what's the best they can do at a higher price point.The machine itself looks really good, and when you turn it on, it's like starting a nice car, it almost purrs.  The electronic start/stop and the electronic height adjustments are fabulous, very refined.  And the machine seems to pick up everything in site.Now, here are a few things to keep in mind, none of which are deal-breakers, but believe me, this thing is not perfect.First and foremost, emptying the dirt chamber.  At first we thought it was like most other bagless machines, you flick a lever and let the stuff fall in your garbage.  But after about a week, we noticed the machine not picking up nearly as well, and we couldn't figure out a thing.Then we looked carefully and saw that a huge collection of hair and debris had collected inside an inner cup, wrapped around the so-called cyclonic device.  Once we got rid of that stuff, the vacuum was like new again.  Still, it is hardly referred to in the manual, and it is rather a messy task.Finally is the 'dirt' indicator.  It works on some sort of audio principle, sending out sounds which come back distored if they run in to dirt.  I find that this works most of the time, but sometimes, it just stays red, and even after going over the area five times, it stays red.I guess one could beef about the extension cord, why they didn't come up with some better way to unreel it and attach it to the machine.  This is just like every other vacuum in that respect, but the cord seems longer.I think I would buy it again, but the bag emptying procedure is sloppy and very unsophisticated.  I'd be looking for machines that might do that job better."
"407","XX","B001PB51GQ","5.0","March 16, 2009","A2FAA09J5RNPG0","This is One Outstanding Vacuum","I recently had to pick up a new vacuum when my old vacuum (an upright that wasn't supposed to lose suction, but which broke down and stopped sucking altogether. At least stopped sucking dirt from the floor, that is) went kaput, and I did some research, trying to find one that was sturdy, had the extra tools, and really picked up dirt. I have two large-ish (50 - 70 pound) dogs that shed a bit, track in some dirt, and can cause carpet chaos, so I really wanted to bring home a powerhouse this time. I liked the early reviews I'd seen on this new Hoover Platinum, and liked how it combined cyclonic action (which I thought was one of those marketing terms, but which actually makes some cleaning sense) and Hoover's own Windtunnel mechanisms (my mom swears by her Hoover she's had forever with this, and hey, you have to be able to trust your mom, right), and so decided it was the vacuum for me. And, I'm darn happy so far that I did. It just picks up more dirt and dog hair from the carpet and upholstery than any vacuum I've had so far, and is great for cleaning all of a big house. Sometimes you just want to spot clean, but if you really want to get at cleaning, and really want cleaning power, this is the vacuum for those jobs. All the tools are a plus, too (especially the long hose and the crevice tool, which are perfect for stairs. Oh, the dusting brush is oddly handy, too. I've never really had one of those that worked that well, but this one's tops. Maybe it's just that the engine and all deliver enough power to make the dusting brush worthwhile, but I use it all the time), and it looks great, and the 6-year warranty is nice, but really, without the suction and dirt-pulling ability, would anything else matter? Nope, which is why I'm glad I made the right choice and went for this new Platinum vaccum, because it really picks up the dirt."

It does bother me that you have to bend over, because of the short hose, and clean around the base boards with the crevice tool because the vacuum does not have an edge cleaner.It is easy to push from room to room and to and from different types of rugs, carpets and bare floors. But the bare floor cleaning leaves a bit to be desired. It kicks small items, such as cereal, bag ties, etc. aside instead of picking them up.The bin is easy to empty, but difficult  to close. A self-propelled model is not available, but this one is not very difficult to push. However, cleaning anything that is six to seven feet above floor level is not possible. This vacuum is also too large to clean under or around anything, but is good for a straight run over a carpet. This unit does require that you use either a stick or a wire clothes hanger every 4-5 uses to clean the lint clogs out of the hoses and other parts so that the vacuum, or sucking power is maintained.Although the wand/hose is very accessible, it has no wand extension for the hose, and you can't get one. Since the hose is very short and a hose extension is not available, you can't clean anything higher than 6 to 7 feet above floor level. So forget drapes, ceilings, or any area under or around tables, beds, sofas, or any type of furniture, etc.The two brush and crevice tools are very small, thin and cheap, and they look like something that would have been included with a $70.00 to $80.00 vacuum cleaner. Hoover did not include a powered hand brush tool or extension wands, like on their previous machines, and the Hoover attachments I have from two other Hoover vacuums will not work with this machine. I don't know why Hoover would include less attachments and tools on their new top-of-the-line machine other than just cost-cutting to maintain a larger net profit.The short hose and the lack of a hose extension and floor and furniture attachments that would normally be part of a premium vacuum machine are missing on this unit. So far, it does a good job only in a straight line on carpets. For anything else you'll have to purchase another type of vacuum cleanerBottom Line - NO, I would recommend this to a friend."

It came boxed in the original Hoover box and was in brand-new condition (they replaced all the parts that get 'dirty' in normal use).  I purchased this vacuum as a replacement for my 12 year old Dyson DC-07.  The Dyson DC-07, although it's old technology was refurbished with a new roller brush and belts (which, BTW are nasty to replace), so it was in like-new condition.All I can say is that I'm delighted with this purchase.  I tested it by vacuuming my living room carpet with the old Dyson and then with the new Hoover Platinum.  The Hoover picked up incredible amounts of dirt that the Dyson left behind.  I had to empty the dirt cup twice for the living room alone.This model is definitely lighter than the Dyson DC-07 and has a much more solid 'feel'.  The motor is 100% quieter.  Again, Dyson has certainly improved their vacuums since 2001, but this Hoover was head-and-shoulders better than the DC-07.I'm absolutely thrilled with this vacuum and I highly recommend searching out a 'factory-refurbished' model in the $130 price range.

Hoover email : it could be thermal protector/motor, but advices to change the filters first,'especially if they have not been replaced yet this year'.The service guy I take it to also wants the filters changed first before he looks at the machine. He will charge $ 60 just to look at it,so I take it home, I can get the filter part done myself.The filters in question are a 'primary filter' that you are supposed to rinse off and a 'HEPA filter' is described in the  owner's manual (p 19): 'The HEPA filter is intended to be a lifetime filter.' Then an instruction describes how to empty it.I feel I should not have to pay for these filters to be replaced. I contact Hoover. Long discussions on the definition of 'lifetime':'Lifetime' is as long as the warranty lasts... lifetime is a vague concept....by definition all filters have to be replaced...He keeps talking about 'the filter on top' or 'the filter on the bottom', even though I'm using the definitions from the manual.I move on from 'customer service' to 'corporate'. This guy wants me to trouble shoot. 'Shall I turn it on?' 'No, plug it in first'...Then questions on whether there's good sucion...roll is moving...???I say all I want is for them to ship out the filters for free, which they will.After that I'll take it to a service place and then hopefully they can look at the motor.The only thing more frustrating than a non functioning vacuum is talking on the phone to a Hoover person."

It should be noted that the Dirt Cup has an almost-invisible 'MAX FILL' line on the side of the Dirt Cup. The suction power of this Vacuum is so strong that the Dirt Cup fills up rapidly, and must be emptied often to prevent buildup and/or clogging of the Red Cyclonic Tubes.Most of the problems noted by others can be prevented by emptying the Dirt Cup when the dirt reaches the 'MAX FILL' line.My UH70015 arrived on time and in perfect condition.

New Owners and/or those who have experienced problems with clogging of the Red Cyclonic Tubes can prevent/avoid this problem quite easily:Look closely to see the 'Max Fill' line on either side of the Dirt Cup. This line is hard to see, but it's IMPORTANT that the dirt does not go above the 'Max Fill' line. Using Bright-Red or Orange nail polish, paint a stripe completely around the Dirt Cup at the 'Max Fill' line., and don't allow the dirt to accumulate above the line.The machine has so much suction power that it often fills up the Dirt Cup after just ONE ROOM of vacuuming !! Wife and I empty the Dirt Cup after vaccuming just the Living Room. It's a slight drawback, but the dirt/debris/doghair never stays in the machine long enough to get smelly, like it did with our previous 'bagged' vacuums and the near-worthless Dyson.When you empty the Dirt Cup, check for dirt accumulation, and if necessary, reach in and remove the 'Umbrella Tube' by twisting it to the left (counter-clockwise) and withdrawing the tube. Remove any dirt/debris and replace the Umbrella Tube.These simple steps will prevent your Hoover Cyclonic from clogging.Yes, it's hard to get used to emptying the dirt cup so often, but that's a small price to pay for the awesome cleaning power of the Hoover Wind Tunnel Cyclonic. In addition to it's awesome suction power, the UH70015 features a push-button height adjuster that eliminates bending over for every change in carpet heights or bare floor.

Additionally, I think Customer Service has completely dropped the ball.The first time I vaccummed, I was shocked at the dirt that came up.  It was short-lived and the vaccuum wasn't picking stuff up; I also noticed balls of hair in the cyclonic part of the vaccuum. Turns out I was missing the umbrella tube and the vaccuum doesn't work without it.  Part was out of stock and took between 2-3 months to receive a new one.  Now the hose will not stay attached to the vaccuum; the only way to vaccuum furniture is to hold the hose at the base while trying to vaccuum with the really short hose.I took the vaccuum to the service center and he said I was missing a gasket and I needed to buy a new hose assembly. I instead called Hoover Customer Service; they said there is no gasket there but needed to bump this up to Technical Support from Customer Support to figure out what's wrong this time.  That was three (maybe four) weeks ago today, and although I've now left my phone number three times, I have yet to receive a callback.Dissapointing product but Customer Service is even worse."

I own a Kirby but felt it was time to try something else. After vacuuming just one room I was amazed at how much my Kirby missed. To get measurable dirt is amazing. To get 6 pounds of dirt in my living room made me sick to my stomach. Yes, you read that right, 6 pounds in one room alone.I will have to agree with the other reviews complaining about the canister being difficult. However, it's worth the frustration for having such a great vacuum at such a good price."

I was also impressed with the specifications.This thing really does pick up so much more than any other vacuum I have ever used. Going over my room after just vacuuming with the bagged vacuum filled up the collection chamber: that's how much the old vacuum was missing!What I also really like is the three part 'collection'- the main chamber for the large particles and things, the fine dust filter at the top, and at the very bottom (take out the middle piece and there is a latch that opens up the base)- there is what appears to be a HEPA or other air-filter of some sort.Other vacuums would simply exhaust anything it didn't pick up, but this machine is purifying the air as it runs.Overeall very impressed. I don't mind cleaning it every time I use it, because at least I know it's doing it's job, right!Others have commented on the amazing suction, and I have to agree- it's amazing.The 'dirt finder' light is actually kind of useful. Going over dark carpets it's hard to tell when it is clean.Overall recommended. I would definitly pay the full price, though I have to admit I got it on a great deal."

"433","XX","B001PB51GQ","5.0","March 5, 2012","A19ZKVUXXLBM6G","Fantastic Vacuum","First of all, my parents own a carpet cleaning business, and I spent 9 years of my life cleaning carpet myself.  I know clean carpet.I've owned 3 different vacuums in my home all of varying quality.  A dirt devil I got off craiglist for $10, a hoover wide path tempo that was $90 or something and then I made the step up to this and it made a complete difference.  The carpet in my house is horrible and grabs string and pet hair like crazy.  The other vacuums would simply not pick it up.  It drove me crazy to bend over and pick up string.  This vacuum gets everything in its first path.  I go over all areas 3 times just to make sure it gets most of the dirt too.  This vacuum picks up a ton of dirt and it gives beautiful vacuum marks in the carpet.I love that the pile height selector is on the handle and you can adjust it easily without bending over.  The brush stops spinning when you put it on the lowest pile height so you can vacuum hard floors.  Also, the brush stops spinning when the vacuum is upright so you don't have to worry when using the attached hose.I read many reviews that said the dust bin is hard to close.  It isn't, you just have to do it right.  You push the button to release and then when you close the lid, push the button again.  Works great.The dirt finder is more for amusement than anything.  It does work.  Where the carpet is obviously dirty it says dirty and where it is obviously clean, it says clean.  However, there are a lot of places that it just won't turn off.  I use it more to amuse myself while vacuuming that for anything.  It's still cool.The only con that I can think of with this vacuum are that the attached hose and wand are pretty short.  Fortunately I have other plastic tubes to connect it with, so it's not a big deal.Remember, for ultimate cleanness you should still think about getting your carpets professionally cleaned at least once a year if they have heavy use.  If you take your shoes off and vacuum twice a week like I do, you can go a little bit longer."

In the past 2 weeks I have vacuumed over and over and over again, and also had my carpet professionally cleaned.  When the vacuum arrived today, I installed the 2 screws and got started.  I could not believe the amount of dirt that I threw away today. (it has to do with where we live!) I seriously want to replace it all with hard wood - I am disgusted.  We will be vacuuming every day now.  As for the machine losing suction, it has a 6 year warranty, really nothing to worry about, right?  In addition to that, the manual is very specific about cleaning your filters at least every 2 months, and certain parts after each use.  For the amount of dirt it picks up, I will gladly clean it after each use!A few others concerns I've seen - not reaching under beds: mine won't go all the way under, but it does go under a few inches.  Opening the canister or re-attaching it to the machine is not difficult.  Closing it is takes a little finesse, but that is because it is sealed very tightly on the bottom.  Just hold down the release button and it snaps right back in place.  About being heavy - it is very easy to push.  I had no difficulty.  I even loaded it in my vehicle and took it down to my friend's house to test her carpet, and it wasn't difficult to lift at all.  In fact, my friend's small 8 year old loaded it when we left.  The sensor works!  In a few traffic areas I went over and over - at least 20 times and the dirty light did not go off.  A while later I came back and worked on it some more, and it finally turned green!"

It does give a bit of a workout pushing it, though, due to its weight.The clean/dirty sign is pretty useless, but I don't rely on it anyway.I really wish it had a hook to keep the cord from getting in the way while vacuuming.It does an 'OK' job on hard/bare floors, but not fantastic.Pros:It's got a really long cord.And most of all, it's got amazing suction.  The greatest suction of any vacuum I've ever owned.This vacuum isn't perfect.  I listed more cons than pros.  However, in my opinion, the number one requirment in a vacuum is to have suction strong enough to really pick up the dirt without having to make multiple passes.

BUT a) the quality of some of the plastic parts is rather low and b) closing the door on the dirt cup after emptying it is rather difficult.On my second use, the hinge to the dirt cup broke.  This means that after emptying the dirt that the vacuum collected, it was not possible to close the compartment again.  Thankfully, Hoover replaced the broken part free of charge, but it is evident that part (and several other parts of the dirt cup) are rather flimsy and I have no doubt that I will be requesting several more replacements over the six year life of the warranty on this vacuum.[Update after over 1 year of ownership]I have NOT had any more broken parts.  Everything is working great.The vacuum still works great.  Picks up a lot of dirt and the HEPA filter keeps the exhaust clean.  I really appreciate being able to turn the floor brush off when vacuuming a hard floor.In future models, however, I would like to see the ability to hold more dirt, a better system for emptying dirt (its kind of awkward), and a type of plastic that doesn't sorb dirt.  After a month or so of use, the clear plastic in the upper parts of the canister gets coated with dirt.  This does not seem to affect proper functioning, but it doesn't look good.."

We have a little Papillon and this vacuumed picked up all the hairs the Bissel left behind!I LOVE the feature that the beater bar shuts off when you engage the hose to use the crevice tools etc. That is such a safety issue when you have children and pets and it's great to know you don't have to worry about a child catching thier fingers or a pet catching it's tail in the beater bar should the vacuum tips over.As for the 'clean/dirty' light..I have only seen the dirty come on once in the entry way so not sure it really does much.There are only 2 things that I feel could be improved upon. The length of the hose is too short to be able to reach all the stairs from one place And I really wanted an auto wind for the electrical cord. 40 feet of cord is nice but you have to hand wind it and if it isn't done tightly it won't fit!"

I'm not a high-end vacuum person, so this was a little more money than I've spent on vacuums in the past, but well worth it!!The plus sides: Amazing suction. More than any other I've owned. I have 2 dogs and 3 kids (8-13 yrs), so that's important. I also love, love, love the clean/dirty indicator light. Honestly, that's what made me take the chance. It works just like it says it does; even when using the wand. I don't even want to think about how dirty I discovered our carpet to be when we vacuumed the first time (again, 2 dogs & 3 kids... eew!). I saw someone's review here that said it gets stuck on dirty sometimes. I hate to break it to them, but it's probably just their carpet! Ok, ok, that's not very nice. Maybe they've got a clog - the one time it happened to me that was the problem. The indicator light has also turned out to be handy for when the kids vacuum the floor. So far it's been really easy to maintain. No problems there at all. Even when the kids try to pick up something too big it's pretty simple to find and get to the source of the problem... I've never even had to ask my husband for help ;) And because it has such great suction it's obvious when there's an obstruction. Then it's right back to full power!The down sides: Well, not so much down sides as things that would be kinda nice: The stretchy wand tube thingy (that's a technical term) could be a little longer. It reaches everywhere I want to go, but I don't have unusually high ceilings or anything like that. I'd also love it to come with a pet hair roller, but that can be purchaced for pretty cheap. Last thing: how great would it be if it had an automatic cord winder, huh? But perhaps that much perfection in a vacuum cleaner is not meant for this world...Bottom line: An awesome vacuum!

When we took it in, we were told the motor went out!  To our surprise, the vacuum repair place told us that we needed to clean the filters every time!  We followed the manual which states to clean the filters every 2 months.  From this point forward, we are making sure that we clean out the filters after every use (despite the manual stating this should be done every 2 months).  This is kind of annoying to do but overall this vacuum is awesome at cleaning carpets.  Also, I agree with some of the other reviews which state that emptying the canister is messy!

I did some research and talked to my mom debating about what kind of vaccum I should purchase. I wanted to get a vaccum that would last and do a good job. I was debating between a dyson and this hoover. My mom went from an electrolux to a hoover wind tunnel and loves her wind tunnel. She had also used my brother's dyson before and was not impressed. She thought I should just get a regular wind tunnel, but I wasn't sure how well it would pick up the dog hair. I read the reviews about this picking up the dog hair so I decided to go with this one plus it had the wind tunnel technology. I have only had this new Hoover for less than a week but it's already amazing. I used to vacuum every 3 days and I thought my carpet was pretty clean. I've been using the Hoover every day since I got it, and the sensor still says dirty, I wouldn't say the sensor is defective because it's still pulling up lots of hair and dust. My carpet used to be a normal tan color and now it's turning almost white. It also looks extremely fluffy compared to how it used to look matted. I also took it to my mom's house, to see what she thought. She had just vaccumed with her wind tunnel and didn't want to re vaccum, but I talked her into it. She too was amazed at how much it picked up off her just vaccumed floor. The sensor turned green after a few swipes in one area on her floor, again proves the sensor is working. I am extremely impressed with this vaccum. It has amazing suction and it fits my needs perfectly. Also the washable filters and the 6 year warranty was huge sellers for me.

I hauled it upstairs as she wanted to try it out in our bedroom.  Later, from downstairs, I heard her start it up.  My immediate thought was 'wow, that's quiet' even compared to our Dyson which we thought was pretty quiet compared to prior models we had owned.  It ran for awhile, much longer than is normally necessary to vacuum our bedroom floor.  After awhile the wife came downstairs and said 'send it back, I can't use this!'  Thought she was joking.  Nope.  She said it was extremely hard to push and to maneuver.  She suffers from problems with her joins, and pushing this vacuum caused her significant shoulder pain that she still hasn't fully recovered from 2 days later.  To make matters worse, she also said it wouldn't pick up most of the stuff on the carpet.  Surprised by this, I went up and tried it myself.  Sure enough, it was hard for me to push, and at 6'2' 250 lbs, I'm not a small guy.  The Dyson felt like a self-propelled model compared to this, and this one is only a few pounds heavier.  And after all that vacuuming I heard her doing, the collection bin only had some dust and a loose ball of fuzz a little smaller than a baseball.  I spotted a little clump of dog hair on the carpet (we have 2 Golden Retrievers, one reason why we're hard on vacuums) and ran the vacuum over it.  It wouldn't budge.  I reached down and picked it up (it wasn't stuck) and just dropped it back down on the top of the carpet.  I ran the vacuum over it at least 10 times, and it just 'smeared' it out along the carpet but would not pick it up.  A little battery powered hand-vac would have picked that up.  The brush roller was spinning, and it had carpet fuzz embedded all in the bristles, so why it couldn't scoop up a clump of loose dog hair sitting on top of the carpet is quite baffling.Perhaps we got a defective unit -- based on the mostly positive reviews I would have to think so.  Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return process. I suspect that we've been spoiled by Dyson, and rather than experiment with another cheaper unit, I think we'll just bite the bullet and purchase another Dyson Animal model."

I finally deceided to spend that at once and make an investment in a good Vacuum that wouldn't crap out in just a couple of months.  So far... so good!  It removed things I had no idea were in my carpet!  But then again, so did the other less expensive vaccums... but this one promises not too lose suction, and so far it hasn't... but time will tell.  I didn't exactly have, nor did I want to drop $500+ on a Dyson... but had always heard good things about Hoover Windtunnel products... So I was prepared to spend about $350 or so on whatever the top of the line Hoover happened to be putting out at the time.  Just so happens that this Vacuum was it... and I only spent $240 shipped... what a deal!The cycolonic technology is amazing... and I love the fingertip controls... no more bending over to adjust the height settings.  All in all.. I am very pleased... it's a great product that I've confidence in and would gladly buy again.  Can't beat a six year warranty.  In fact, I was so impressed with it I turned around two weeks later and purchased the matching Platinum Carpet Cleaner... and got a great deal on THAT through Amazon as well!

"465","XX","B001PB51GQ","4.0","May 14, 2011","A2WK7A8K9VTWRS","Still a power machine after almost 2 years","In some negative reviews, you will read how emptying the cannister is messy, or too frequent, and the inner pole needs to be cleaned regularly.  Well, here's why I don't mind any of those.  I love that EVERY time I use my Hoover Cyclonic, it picks up great quantities of stuff on the floor.  The more junk that falls into the trash can, the cleaner the floor.  You just need to stick the cannister into the trashcan, not several inches above, or yes, you will get a cloud of debris everywhere.  Cleaning the removable wand/pole/whatever it is called inside is no problem.  It gets hair and lint wrapped around it, and in a few seconds I get that off, stick it back in, and vacuum away.The suction is still great after owning this machine for almost two years.  The absolute best part about this vacuum is that it works well on hard floors in addition to carpeting.  I find the hard floor setting DOES NOT scatter dirt and dog hair around like other machines.  Even though it's big, it cleans my hard floors far better than any stick vacuum or Swiffer pad.  I have tried other smaller lighter vacuums for my kitchen, but they never seem to completely get everything up.  This Hoover is the only machine I've ever owned that truly picks up on hard floors bigger things like dried leaf fragments and bits of paper to sand and dust particles.  And on carpets?  It cleans them and makes them so fluffy!  Like I said, the proof is in the filled up cannister!  We have a dog, and I wouldn't want to be without my Hoover.We just bought a house, and I took my Hoover Cyclonic over to vacuum the upstairs--all carpeted.  The house is 5 years old, and the carpet looks fine.  However, I don't know what kind of vacuum the former owners used, but my Hoover removed so much fine dirt.  After each room, the cannister was nearly full, and the carpets were noticably cleaner.I am giving my Hoover 4 stars because it has ruined two area rugs.  I should have known better not to run the vacuum over them on the low carpet setting.  The brushes on low carpet setting will eat up your lightweight, smaller rugs (but hard floor setting won't, deep carpet setting seems to be okay too). Also, I hate the button on the front of the cannister that never seems to stay latched.  I had read about this issue in a review before I bought the machine, so I know it is a strange defect.  It's not a huge deal--just means that when you take the cannister out to empty it, the top becomes detached. Nothing spills because the bottom where you empty it is still capped, you just have to close the top lid and hit the button until it clicks again. If it wasn't for this weird thing and the rug killer brushes, I would give my Hoover 5 stars, because I really LOVE how well it sucks crap out of the carpet and off hard floors!Update:  May 10, 2012--Still works like a champ after 3 years.  It still removes tons of dirt and hair from our carpets."
"466","XX","B001PB51GQ","2.0","May 11, 2011","A3JCZTODUAT2XB","Great suction, messy and awkward to clean.","We have had this vacuum for about one and half years.  It replaced a Hoover self-propelled that died after 10 years.We have a lot of dogs (five at last count). That means dog hair is everywhere, and lots of dust too.  This vacuum does a great job pulling dog hair off carpet.  The four floor height adjustments are easy to access from the handle.  Rolls well.  However, the hose and wand are too short.  Brush and crevice tools are very small.  This vacuum is not well suited for anything but carpeted floors.The worst thing about this vacuum is the dust bin/cyclone system.  Hair gets wrapped around the 'tree'.  The dust bin has to be emptied 4 or 5 times every time we clean. It can be difficult to close and latch the dust bin cover.  Don't forget to reinsert that 'tree'.  We have to go outside to the garage to empty it because there is so much dust that gets all over when emptied into the kitchen waste can.  Dust clings to all of the interior plastic.  Cyclone tubes clog with pet hair.  Cleaning the cyclone tubes requires unscrewing about 8 screws and then blowing it out with an air compressor.There may be better bagless vacuums.  For us, we are going back to bags."

I suffer from allergies and researched for a vacuum that would do a great job without a +$500 tag.  If you're in a similar position, see the PROs/CONs of my experience so far, and exaggerated information (IMO) out there:PROs1.  Filtration system, including reusable HEPA filter: This vacuum traps everything, including allergens like dust mites (according to manufacturer's claims).  But I did notice a significant improvement with my allergies after I started using this vacuum.  The washable HEPA filter gives me control over the vacuum's performance by allowing me to clean it and without the need for replacement filters every couple months.2.  Suction system: This is my first Hoover, and I was so impressed with the suction system.  It picked up dust left behind my old vacuum, and even the dust found under the carpet.3.  Relatively quiet motor considering all that is going on.CONs: The 2 issues below are the reason I took away a start from this item, and only gave it 4 out of 5.1.  It is difficult to use the accessories hose because it is kind of short.  It is difficult to vacuum hard to reach places because the hose does not extend too much.2.  Limited reach under furniture: Vacuum canister can get a bit on the way when trying to reach under furniture.EXAGGERATED INFO (IMO): While reading reviews, I came across some users' feedback that made me think twice about whether this item was right for me.  However, I found some of that feedback to be a bit exaggerated.  And that is:1.  Emptying Canister: I kept coming across complaints on emptying the canister.  It is not a big deal.  I just place the canister inside a bag, press the button to release it open, and use my hand (through exterior) to close it.  Yes, it would be nice to click the button again to close, but it is not that difficult.2.  Dealing with dust while Emptying Canister: Honestly, this will happen with any bagless vacuum.  And lint/'stuff' can get stuck can get stuck in tubes, but it is nothing that takes more than 30 seconds to clean.3.  Too Heavy to Move: It is a big vacuum, somewhat bulky, but it is not too heavy given its size.  Perhaps people are not using the right carpet height setting while vacuuming, causing the machine to get stuck on the carpet.Overall, I would purchase this item all over again, and would recommend it to others.  Hope you find this info to be useful."

"472","XX","B001PB51GQ","4.0","March 23, 2011","AO47XMIIHFIHQ","The great and the not so good","I give this vacuum 4 stars for two primary reasons: (1) the Hoover is a monster at sucking up pet hair and (2) the Hoover is a monster.We have three dogs and a long-haired cat, and of course they all shed 50 weeks out of the year.  We have had a Meile for the past 16 years -- it has been a great vacuum, but it just didn't seem to have the power to deal with the hair, especially on our wall-to-wall carpet. The hair ate the Meile's power head, and we did not want to spend money to buy an entirely new Meile (~$600).  For everything other than the wall-to-wall carpets, the Meile is still a great vacuum.  So, now we are a two-vacuum, one-car family!On our wall-to-wall carpet, the Hoover has out done itself.  As other reviewers have said, this thing could suck a golf ball through a garden hose, which means it can really suck some hair off the carpet.  It took three complete vacuum events to get the carpets clean and hair free (meaning the canister was full and had to be cleaned out three times).  Our carpets look the best they have since they were installed, not new, but very good considering 4 animals and 2 kids have used them every day for 3 years.  I then used the Hoover in our linoleum kitchen, which usually has dog-hair bunnies running around 2 hours after I vacuum.  Goodbey bunnies!  The Hoover pulled hair out from under the stove without moving the stove.  It cleaned a throw rug we keep in the 'eat in' part of the kitchen so that it looks new.  It did an exceptional job.Now, I have read on Amazon that some of the parts on the Hoover seem a little flimsy. There is some truth to this: the buttons on the vacuum's handle don't have a quality feel to them. The bagless enclosure, however, seems very well built.  It just needs the right touch to get it securely closed, but this is nothing to worry about.  The enclosure is easy to clean out -- the bottom pops open and the contents fall out.  All vacuums get nasty and have to be cleaned, however, and I would guess that this canister will need a more thorough cleaning once very 6 months.  That is to be expected.  The Hoover's filter needs to be cleaned every 6 months, so I will probably clean the whole thing when I clean the filter.  (I clean the Meile about every 6 months.)A couple of other things to note: for a vacuum this powerful, the Hoover is pretty quiet.  Both my wife and I were impressed by this fact when none of the dogs seemed afraid of 'the vacuum monster.'  In a house with as much happening as our house, a quite vacuum is a nice thing to have. Last, the power cord is long, which is nice.  I forgot that with an upright vacuum, you have to manage the cord when you vacuum.  This is a much bigger hassle than it is with the Meile, but it is to be expected.  Finally, the cord wraps around two hard-plastic 'pegs' for storage, just like my parents' Hoover vacuum did in the early 1970s.  It seems odd that a better method for cord management has not been identified, but I guess I can get my 'old fashioned' on with the Hoover.Now for the not so good: the Hoover is big.  I mean really big.  The head is large enough so that it minimizes the number of passes necessary to clean a carpet, but this can also be a liability.  Our house is 100 years old, and the living and dining rooms have lots of wood and lots of nooks and crannies.  The Meile has been great at cleaning these.  There is no way the Hoover will ever be able to do the job of the Meile.  The hose attachment on the Hoover is far too short (laughably so) for much of anything at all.  (Forget about getting it to spider webs on our 10-foot ceilings.) Further, the tools that come with the Hoover are not very useful.  The crevice tool is fine but the upholstery brush is worthless.  This means the Meile will have to continue to be the tool for vacuuming our couches, chairs, and other furniture.  The Hoover will be a welcome addition to cleaning our large area rugs, but that is about it in our more formal living spaces.In sum, I think this would be a great vacuum for a family living in a big open house with some pets keeping the kids company.  The part of our house that meets this criterion will benefit mightily from the Hoover.  It is the best vacuum I have seen when it comes to cleaning wide swaths of carpet that gets a high degree of traffic.  It also sucks pet hair like a fiend.  If you have a lot of woodwork to vacuum the dust from, however, the Hoover will be a disappointment.  Further, if you plan to use the vacuum to clean off your upholstery, there are better tools out there.  All of that said, this vacuum is a solid 4-star product."

I cleaned a room with the old vacuum, then immediately followed with the hoover, I nearly filled the canister, wow!

The light on the front is very bright and the power height adjustment is a nice touch. The hose does feel short but does stretch pretty far. Our only complaint was the way the canister is emptied, which is the same way dyson does theirs, it seems to make a mess worse than the cup type. We have only had this for about a month so maybe we will develop a better technique for emptying.

The hose is much too short to be of any asset at all, and the absence of extension hoses renders it practically useless for even basic cleaning. The dirt cup and its emptying process is one of the poorest designs I've ever seen; be prepared to re-sweep the floor when you're finished.

My household includes a large indoor dog (who is very old and sprawls all over the floors all the time), an indoor cat, 2 boys, & 3 adults and I am SO confident that my carpets (and bare floors) are clean after I've used it.  The 40-foot cord is such a convenience I will never accept anything less ever again - I can plug it in just once and vacuum my entire 2000+ sq ft home.  It is very light & easy to push, and the thigh-height handles (front & back) make it super easy for me (or my kids...) to carry up & down stairs.  The height-adjustment controls on the handle are great - no more bending over to turn a knob on the vacuum head (whoever designed those is an idiot), and the suction on this thing is incredible.  The CLEAN/DIRTY sensor seems like a gimmick but I actually find it very useful and often notice that I go back over an area that I would've otherwise thought was already plenty clean.  It could do with an additional extender for the wand, but I just use the one from my old Hoover.  For less than $20 I highly-recommend you invest in the Hoover Turbine Hand Tool - it's well worth it and combined with this vacuum will make you feel like a carpet-cleaning Wonder Woman (or Super Man...).  My husband had bought this vacuum for his office and I borrowed it when our home vacuum started to poop-out.  I liked it a lot but still shopped around and compared this to other vacuums such as the Dysons and could not see that there was any advantage in spending another $300 for the Dyson unless you are extremely name-brand & style-conscious.  It's a vacuum, people, not evening wear.  I thought I'd keep my old vacuum so I'd have one for upstairs & one for downstairs, but after using this one I would not go back to my old vacuum if someone paid me to.  It's going out to the Goodwill.  I've been using this vacuum for a few months now and no problems at all.

One thing frequently mentioned in the reviews was comparison of the cleaning using the old vacuum with the new one, I did not find that helpful because if you are looking at a new vacuum it usually means the one you have isn't working well and i would expect the new one to pick up more dirt.  The issues that made me pick the hoover was the deficients pointed out with the dyson, for that kind of money I don't want to hear about problems with hose / attachments.Why did I pick the hoover?  Well it's got a 6 yr warranty and its $130 cheaper than the dyson (same price at walmart).  Why do I think I made the right choice? well it has a 6 yr warranty, cheaper than dyson and my rugs stay cleaner longer (yeah).  Instead of 2 or more times a wk i vacuum once a week and the rugs still look good even with a hairy dog and a teenager.  time will tell if this last fingers crossed!!!There are some things that could be better like the hose doesn't stay put when using the attachment and the book doesn't address attaching the hosethe designation for clean and dirty, not sure what the need is for that would prefer they spent the money on more attachments like a hand held for the stepsmy other hoover had an auto cord rewind which i really liked but not on this machine guess that the price you pay for the longer cord.  the screws to attach the handle are not properly placed.Suction is important but let us not forget about workmanship!!********update***********************************************looks like I spoke to soon, after less than one month of use this is being returned, the rollers stop working and I don't know why and don't care, for this kind of money on a vacuum I not playing MS Fitit this soon.

Vacuuming in an every day task in our home so we wanted something Heavy Duty. I'm happy to report that I've had this vacuum for 6 months now and vacuum almost every day with fantastic results.The vacuum has excellent suction power, it made my carpets look new again the first time I went over them. The long cord means I can vacuum almost the entire first floor of my house without having to change outlets. The hose is a bit shorter than I'm used to but still has excellent suction power and the upholstery brush actually gets pet hair off the furniture unlike every other vacuum I've ever used.It does have a problem, which for me is not enough to make less than a 5 star rating but could cause a problem for someone else. The dustcup is rather small, and we pretty much empty it after each room. If you are not diligent about noticing when the cup is full and emptying it you will lose suction and get dirt and debris in the tunnel chamber and you'll have the very messy job of pulling out by hand. However if you are good about properly emptying it, you can empty the dust cup normally and not lose suction.Overall I feel this was a great purchase and one I would gladly recommend to friends and family."

I used it today on hard floor for mostly dog hair.  The way the air exits the unit it creates airborne hair and dust.  This is especially a problem around the wood stove where there is often ash on the ash fender of the stove.  The fender is about 6' above the floor and when the vacuum is near the fender it blows ash from the fender and also from the floor into the air creating more work for dusting of furniture in the room.  With dog hair it also will blow hair from the floor into the air where it settles on furniture.At 25', the power cord is too short and there is a 90 degree fitting at the bottom rear of the unit which you often hit with your foot when disengaging the rotating brush.  This creates low suction which can go unnoticed.It does have an easy to empty canister and a good filtration system.  However the filtration system is not much good when so much duct is blown into the air by the exhaust.No, I would not recommend this to a friend."

I have to say, the one thing I miss, is being able to just go right under a table with the canister vac. That's the only thing I am not as crazy about with the Dyson. They do have the wand which you pull out to use to go under tables, couches and do stairs etc. Just that that is one more thing you have to stop and do. Otherwise, love this vacuum! The ball technology is neat! It pivots the vac to go left or right. Very easy to maneuver. Suction is great, and love the see thru collection container for the dust. Easy to empty. Really like the foot peddle that you press to put the vacuum in use. Glad there is nothing you have to buy for this vacuum. Just rinse out the filter, and empty cup, no bags to purchase. I would have liked it if the button to turn it on were more towards the top, but it is placed mid way down right next to the button that you press for the brush to turn or not for when doing floors.

We have one large dog that unfortunately sheds a lot.  This picks up hair in the carpeted areas that our other vacuums had missed. We have carpet, hardwoods, tile and area rugs.  The dyson does great on everything but one area rug.  It is a long shag type rug and the dyson just has too much suction for it.  Even turning off the beater brush, it is very hard to move forward.  You can only pull the vacuum so we have to use a canister model - not dyson. Too much suction is not a bad thing!  The bagless feature is wonderful - you can see when you need to dump the canister since it is clear and you can dump it more often since you aren't replacing a bag every time.  The ball design is easy to maneuver and does great around baseboards and furniture.  I clean the filters about twice a year and it is simple and easy.  So far this vacuum has been maintance free.

"500","XX","B001EFMD8W","2.0","November 25, 2011","A3OB0D11YLHT6T","How do I hate thee, let me count the ways...","I gave this two stars because it does, after all, pick up dirt off the floor, which is the main function of a vacuum cleaner.  But if you want to do anything else, it is very awkward.  As an engineer, I appreciate an innovative and elegant design, but this is neither.  It is different, but that doesn't make it better.1) The most annoying part of this vacuum cleaner is the handle for the tools.  It has been pre-determined that you will want a three foot long handle.  If you want to use it for a closer task like dusting, you can remove the handle and use just the hose, but gone is the option to use one or two short sections as the job demands.  Combine this with a stiff hose that fights you constantly, and cleaning the stairs becomes a real fight.2) The hose is a reasonable length (a good hard stretch will get you about 8 feet), but you need to somehow anchor the unit behind some furniture to get more than about three feet out of it (remember that the handle itself is three feet long).  Just to put the crevace tool on and clean the corners of the floor, you need to yank on the hose hard enough to drag the vacuum cleaner with you the whole time.3) The hose is incompatible with any other tools or hose extensions that you might have around from previous vacuum cleaners.  Got a tool that has always worked for a special task (refrigertator coils, for example)? Forget about it.  Duct tape is your best hope of making it work.4) The poorest options for a dust brush I have ever met.  You get two options: too big, and too small.  What was wrong with the do-all 3 inch round brush that everyone else uses? I'm not sure, but now you get the cute little retractable one inch by two inch brush on the end of the crevace tool (while fighting the hose) or the eight inch brush that I haven't found a use for yet.  Want to use your old 3 inch brush?  See comment #3.  And that eight inch brush finds itself in the closet, because there's nowhere to store it on-board.5) The little clip on the cord is ineffective and difficult to use.  What was wrong with the clamp molded into the back of the plug, like everyone else uses (except for the fact that someone else invented it)?  This separate clip is hard to operate, and the point-contact clip doesn't grab anywhere on the round wire.  At best, it clamps around the wire, and then the cord is loose, and catches on things as you wheel past them.  Just dumb.6) The clear dust bin is good for seeing when it is full, but it is dificult to empty.  Pressing one button is convenient, but you then find that the dust bunnies and hair picked up off the floor get caught on the rubber seal, and need to be cleaned out by hand anyway.  After about a dozen uses, the bin becomes so dusty that it is essentially translucent, not transparent, which will drive most clean-freaks nuts.It does actually have a few clever ideas going for it.  The washable filters are very useful, and fairly easy to remove and check/wash.  I like that you can turn off the beater brush when you need to, unlike my old vacuums.  And yes, it does corner like a Ferrari.  I'm not quite sure why my vacuum cleaner needs to perform like a super car, but it does.  Perhaps a clever ploy to get men to vacuum?In short, I applaud Dyson for trying some new ideas, but they went overboard, and fixed things that weren't broken.  An innovative design would have employed a new approach to solve a problem.  An elegant design would do that in a simple way that would cost less and be easier to use.  This is neither.  Instead, it seems to be an ego-stroke for the designer, to see how many things they could do differently, so as to impress the consumer - which would be OK if the resulting product was better. This one's just more expensive."

Completely unacceptable for the price.  While I feel that the suction is just GOOD, it doesn't live up to all the hype; the vacuum is composed mostly of plastic and we've had problems with the brush/nosepiece which keeps snapping, the wand, and other plastic pieces.  Whenever I pick up the vacuum, the nosepiece just falls down vertically when you pick it up.  Wand is very 'un-user-friendly' and cannot be easily detached without some effort.  When you DO get the wand off, it's bulky, and doesn't work well on most pieces of standard furniture.  I have another vacuum that I paid $100 for (Panasonic) which I use in concert with my DC25.  The vacuum is also awkward to place into the upright, locked position, and I find myself using strong jerking actions to get the vacuum locked and unlocked (really bad for those folks with orthopedic issues like tennis elbow).  The vacuum is heavy despite the abundance of plastic used in its' frame.  Also, the canister is miserably small; I only have a 2700 square foot home and have to empty the canister at least two times when I'm doing a marathon house cleaning session.  The canister is easy to empty, and unline the other negative review I read, the canister comes apart in two pieces so that you never have to reach your hand inside of it to empty it.Overall, it's a very expensive piece of equipment.

Aside from being heavier and having a bag, it only picked up a portion of the stuff from the pup and it didn't have much reach when using the wand.This machine (like my other Dyson) is a dream. It is lightweight and extremely portable. It has a long telescoping wand that reaches 16 feet and comes with a full complement of accessories. It self adjusts to all floor surfaces and finishes. I also get a lot of sand at the house I'm using it at and it picks up even the grains that get stuck between the floorboards. The suction that this machine generates is like a tornado. It maneuvers nicely on its pivot and gets into all sorts of tight and inconvenient nooks and crannies. It has two permanent filters that take little effort to clean under a running tap and air dry about once a month. The waste bin opens with a quick touch and disposal involves putting the bin over a waste can.The gross but good thing is that the clear container exposes all the icky things the Dyson has collected. For the heck of it, after I vacuum I empty the bin and do a second pass over the clean rugs, floors, and furnishings.

With the DC25 I can be 6-12 inches away from dust, lint, dog hair, etc and it will get pulled into it.My only regret is I waited so long to get one fearing it was all over priced hype. Boy is my face red now. I should have gotten one years ago."
"519","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","October 1, 2011","A6BBNLA4OIYVH","A great vacuum","I haven't provided many product reviews, but thought that I should with the Dyson DC25 Animal.  My wife and I have a Newfoundland dog, those who know the breed know that dog hair and dog slobber are fashion accessories in our house.  The DC25 can't help with the slobber, but it does a terrific job in cleaning up the hair.  Our point of reference in vacuums is a Big Vac canister we bought from Jeff Campbell's Clean Team back in the early '90s and an Oreck XL upright we bought about 12 years ago.  We still have both and have been able to compare the three side-by-side.  Here's what we like about the DC25:The ball - When I saw the ball on the TV commercials, I thought it was a gimmick.  I've found it does help in moving the vacuum around.  But more importantly, I found that the ball carries the weight, rather than the beater bar.  This is important when it is used on plush carpets (which is in a finished basement) as it makes the vacuum easy to move on the thicker carpet.  I broke the fan chamber on the Oreck using it on the plush carpeting, because the fan chamber is also the mounting point for the handle.  With all the weight of the vacuum on the base/beater bar, it was difficult to push on the thicker carpet and the stress from the handle broke the fan chamber.  When I had it repaired, the owner of the shop asked if I had sucked in a hairpin or bobbypin, as he has seen the same damage from that.  He also told me that there was no way he knew to provide the adjustment needed to prevent this from happening again.  It wasn't an expensive repair, but I didn't expect that kind of problem with the Oreck.  The Big Vac did OK on the plush, but the DC25 was much easier to use on the plush (this is more a canister vs. upright discussion in my view).The beater bar motor shut off - We haven't had a vacuum with this feature, but it is very handy when moving from carpet to hardwood.  This reduces the risk of damaging the floor (although with a big dog it would be hard to tell what is from her and what is from the vacuum).  It also means you don't need to change the hose-end attachment from the beater bar head to the solid floor head, as with the Big Vac.The suction - We started looking at the DC25 after a Rainbow demonstration in our house.  I agree with the Rainbow guys, suction/air flow is key to effective vacuuming.  We don't care for a canister vacuum (we used the Big Vac for a number of years before the Oreck and much preferred the upright Oreck).  However, I can't see spending over $2K for a new Rainbow, even $1K for a used one is too much in my view.  Also, we do have a couple of friends who have had Rainbows in the past, they stopped using them after a few years because the water feature (adding water before you start, thoroughly cleaning out the water basin after finishing) was very inconvenient for them.  The DC25 has great suction and seems to maintain it as the canister fills.  A word of warning, if there is a loose thread in the carpet or rug, the DC25 will find it.  I ran it over a throw rug, which I had done with the Oreck many times over the past few years.  The DC25 sucked a loose thread up into the beater bar and I had about 5 feet of thread wrapped around it in a matter of a second or two.  This brings me to the next point,The beater bar - I really like the way you can easily remove the beater bar.  Use a coin to turn a button to unlock the side plate, rotate the side plate, and the bar slides out.  With long dog hair, it will get wrapped around the bar.  By being able to remove the bar, it makes it very easy to get the hair (and the carpet thread mentioned above) off.  With both the Big Vac and the Oreck, you need to pull the hair off the bar with it in the machine or do some amount of disassembly.  I would leave the machines assembled and use a utility knife to cut the hair between the brushes, then pull it off.  I would need to disassemble both of them a few times a year, as the hair would be wrapped around the bearings on the ends and start to jam the bar, which resulted in the belt not turning (you can smell the rubber heat up when this happens).  This has not been a problem with the DC25.Noise - the DC25 is much quieter than the Oreck and about the same as the Big Vac.  As a tangent to the noise level, the Oreck seems to generate a sound frequency that is disturbing to the dog, as she stays as far away as she can from it, even to the point of jumping over furniture.  It is an amazing sight to see 115 lbs. of airborne dog.  This has not been a problem with the DC25 or the Big Vac, the dog stays well grounded.  Newf owners will concur that these dogs have a talent for holding down the floor.Other reviews have mentioned that the cord is too short and the canister too small, we see these two as minor inconveniences.  For the main floor of our house (2,000 sq ft) we need to use three outlets to reach everywhere with the DC25.  When we need to move the plug to cover the next area, the cansiter is also dumped, so these complaints are not a big concern for us.  Another concern mentioned is in dumping the canister.  The bags in the Oreck and Big Vac aren't difficult to change, but we haven't found that dumping the DC25 canister to be a problem.  Push the gray release button and the canister comes off, hold it over your trash container and push the red button and the bottom of the canister pops open.  We haven't noticed any significant amount of dust being put in the air from this, but I imagine that could happen.  Also, the bags for the Big Vac are available online only, the Oreck bags are available online or at an Oreck store; you need to keep a supply in your home for any bag-based vacuum.  Bag availability is not a problem with the DC25.Our only recommendation to Dyson is to add a light to the head, the Oreck has that and it is a nice feature when you are in areas that are poorly lit.Some may be concerned about the price, ours was delivered at about $500.  This is about what we paid for the Oreck in '99, the Big Vac was about $400 in '91.  For us, this seems about the right price point for a premium vacuum.  A relative bargin compared to the Rainbow ;-)"

Bought it recently, and at first I was 100% enthusiastic. I vacuumed my living room first with my old vac (Sebo) and then did it with the Dyson. I couldn't believe how much dirt the old vac left behind. So even though the electric cord was very short, I thought it was a great vac. Then as I used it more I discovered that the size of the bin that collects the dirt is so small that I had to stop often to empty it. Ok, not a huge deal. Inconvenient, but it was really getting things clean. The problem came with using the attachments on the wand. That was initially ok, but then one of them got stuck. I mean really stuck. No matter what I did I couldn't get it off. I had to get my neighbor, and he had a terrible time getting it off. He works for a sawmill, so it wasn't a matter of not being strong. He put it back on, and it immediately got stuck again. Ok, for that much money I can't call my neighbor every time I want to get an attachment off. I took it back and bought one of the Hooever WindTunnel vacs for under $200, and it works every bit as well as the Dyson, plus it has a long cord and you press a button and the cord retracts itself. And the bin for the dirt is larger. So you decide - if you want to spend $250 more for the Dyson name, go for it. Otherwise, I'd say there is no need to waste your money. Very disappointed in the Dyson!"
"521","XX","B001EFMD8W","1.0","September 22, 2011","A4UPUO45NHFS1","Absolutely hate this vacuum","I don't know... I'm thinking the people who are so excited and love this machine are just not willing to admit they made such a terrible mistake in spending so much money on it.  Misery must love company, eh?  Well, I'm not ashamed to admit I made a mistake, and I want to prevent others from doing the same.  This vacuum is NOT worth your hard-earned money.1) Bagless vacuum = DISGUSTING.  Now, I know that's not entirely a Dyson thing... but at least a Dirt Devil doesn't make me fork over $500 to get grossed out.  Not only that, this thing needs dumped so often, it's ridiculous, and the hair turns into a huge matted dirty mass around the middle of the canister that you have to dig out with your hands.  Ugh, so nasty.2) It's poorly made.  Chintzy.  Even when you just set it upright and try to click it into place it feels... fragile.  Not solid at all.  It's just so cheap-feeling.  I could not believe it costs as much as it did.  There can't be $20 worth of plastic in the whole thing.  I have a kid's toy Dirt Devil that feels more well-made than this.3) The attatchments are terrible and mine actually quit working for some mysterious reason (unable to find any sort of blockage, etc.) so now I don't even have a usable hose/attatchments at all.4) It's difficult to maneuver.  Granted, I was coming from a Kirby, that was motorized and helped push itself about... but really?  You have to hold the Dyson Animal up as you are using it.  There's no base to stand on.  No 'back' to it... no back wheels or stand.  Again, not solid whatsoever.  So you're pushing it around AND holding it up at the same time.  It's a pain.  Don't dare let it go to pick up a toy or something on the floor... kerplunk!  Over it falls.  That is, unless you try to push it upright first.  Good luck with that, though.  Click.  Click.  CLICK.  Omg why won't it just STAND UP??5) Roller ball fail.  That is all.  It gets nasty too and it's difficult to clean.  And what is up with that filter in there?  Really?  There's a filter in the ball.  So... that must mean there's... air... going through the ball?  Indeed.  What is that filter for exactly?6) No carpet height settings.  Why?  It wants us to believe that all carpets need the same amount of suction?Bottom line, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  You deserve better than this.  Your money should be worth more to you than this piece of junk."

It is so easy and painless to empty it and I now realize that if my other vacs were picking up half what the dyson does (which I doubt), I did not change the other bags near enough.  Instead of the dirt going into a dark hole, I can see when it's time to empty it.I have two cats and two dogs. The animal attachment was completely worth it when I saw how much stuff and hair it lifted off my couches.Bottom line, this vacuum is awesome and worth it."

It works great.2. It sucks.3. I used it for a long time and need to balance the other reviews on the product.Since the DC 25 animal uniquely satifies 1 and 2, I thought I needed to provide a review.Background:I had a Hoover Windtunnel (4 years old) and recently moved to a new home. When using my vacuum, I noticed that it was tough to move across the carpet and that it was not picking up all the artifacts on the floor. I took the vacuum apart and confirmed clear hosing and agitator. I also confirmed the wheels worked on the vacuum.  The reason for the difficulty for carpet was the strong sucking power (it pulled the carpet/not the dirt), the old wheels and (a downgraded) carpet.The Test:Now, I found this vacuum for sale at a local store.  Having a great return policy, I decided to make this purchase and put the vacuum to the test.Not only did it pick up everything that the Hoover did not pick up from the same area rug and carpet, it was done effortlessly (by both the vacuum and the person pushing it). The AMOUNT of dirt, hair and lint it picked up was unbelievable.Result:The ball technology lowered the center of gravity of the vacuum, eased the passes on the carpet and improved maneuverability. The vacuum really sucked (in a good way). My wife loves it.I have never tried an Oreck or similar. All I know is that I am very pleased with the purchase.CONS!!!The only CON I have is the canister. It is small. Not only did it fill quickly. Once it is partially full, it does not pick up the finer dirt and dust. Once the canister is emptied, I passed through the same are to get more dirt. This was after our first experience with the vacuum. I figured once we use this vacuum more often, the rate to empty the canister will drop. I do not think this CON satisfies a drop in a star."

My cleaning person was here today with her bagless vacuum, which picked up more than my Kirby did. I thought I would look at the Dyson both on line and in the stores. Finally found the Animal, brought it home, and vacuumed where the cleaner had vacuummed only a couple of hours before. I vacuummed 3 area rugs and a hallway...then I had to empty the canister!

So when choosing my new vacuum, I leaned towards another Dyson and decided on the Animal Ball since I wanted to see what 5 years of innovation would turn out.  The verdict after a month of use is that this thing seems over-engineered to perform a simple task...guess I got what I asked for.  The good is that it is very light, can turn at almost a 90 degree angle with ease, seems to do an adequate job of cleaning, and the canister although small is big enough for at least 4-5 cleanings before it has to be emptied (someone said they emptied theirs 3 or 4 times per cleaning and I don't see how that can be).  The bad is that it seems fragile--not the material, but the way it is engineered and put together.  The canister doesn't have a tight fit as my old one; I'm pretty sure this is by design but it still doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.  Every time I recline the vacuum, I'm a little wary of the release mechanism breaking.  I guess most of my criticisms are subjective and only time will tell whether it is a durable machine.  I would get the non-ball version if I were to do it again, but then again, I don't do most of the vacuuming."

It will not get into the corners of your kitchen, but will have great suction in the general area of your home.  I returned it (didn't buy through Amazon).  Then I thought I wanted to try the DC24 and was immediately disappointed, returned it same day.  With regard to the Dyson 33, it has a great long cord that would reach into 3 rooms without unplugging and the 24 didn't get through one room.  Also, the attachments are very hard to work with as you have to pull the hose attachment out backwards, etc...just not a good buy.So I, still wanting a Dyson, decided to purchase the DC25, the animal version even though we have no animals.  Well, first off, the cord is longer, secondly, it gets great suction will get into corners and the attachments are easy to use. Love it.  I have both throw rugs and hard wood.  There is a button to press for each.  Don't waste your time with the 33 and the 24.  The only thing I would suggest to improve the Dyson 25 is to make the cord as long as the 33.

Both animals are heavy shedders and their hair gets stuck everywhere (underneath low lying furniture, on furniture, under appliances, basically everywhere). So I wanted a vacuum that would be able to get under low lying places without me having to bend under much. DC25 was built to be able to fit under places that other vacuums cannot. With a head thats low to the ground I can get pretty far underneath the furniture without having to pick the furniture up and move it! Works really well on tile too!!! So with no belt, no bags, and long lasting lifetime filters the vacuum pays for itself eventually. I would go through a bag or more a week and replaced so many belts on my old vac to count (and this vac would have saved me a lot of money in the end).

This one's for the folks that are used to using lighter-weight canister vacuums, as I was.  When I first pulled this thing out of the box (mangling the packaging in the process), I thought, 'Did I just make a $400 mistake?'  It seemed SO heavy compared to my old vacuum.  And when I used it for the first time, the sinking feeling in my gut deepened -- it was tougher than I thought it would be to maneuver around on hard floors, I missed my floor brush, and the extension hose was so stiff that my arm was sore for three days after doing the stairs.I'm a few months out from my purchase now, and I have to say: I'm glad I took the plunge.  I have carpet runners on my stairs and in my hallways and wall-to-wall in the attic, and this machine cleans them beautifully.  You can see the vacuum suck in dirt and hair off the hardwood floor as far away as a couple of feet.  I feel more competent about wheeling it around the house.  Either I'm getting stronger or the hose is getting broken in, because it doesn't seem as tough as it used to be.  But the best part is probably the reduction in my husband's allergies, and that ain't no small thang.If I had to do it again, I might buy one of the smaller, lighter models (or even the stick version) and buy the mini turbine head separately to do stairs and upholstery.

We bought our first Dyson Animal vacuum back in 2005 and it was fantastic.  We used and abused it for over four years (we have a large dog) before we had any real problems with it.  After getting it serviced for $50 at a local repair shop, it worked great once again.  Tired of lugging it up and down the stairs, I decided to buy a second one (this model) for the second level of our house.  At first it worked alright--their claim that these vacuums 'don't lose suction' is true--but we have had nothing but problems with this vacuum since we bought it last year.  The beater bar quit spinning (we got it working again after taking it apart with the help of their 800 number), the canister is much smaller than the last one (I have to empty it before I'm even half done vacuuming our 600 sq. foot living room), but today was the last straw.  Less than a year after I bought this vacuum, it literally fell apart while I was using it.  I pulled the attachment out (according to the directions--I'm no Incredible Hulk), and the vacuum hose literally fell off the attachment and it won't go back together.  So I'm done with Dyson.

It's very powerful, easy to use, easy to care (I'm a woman with not much upper body strength and can easily carry it around). I love the ball function and how easily it turns on carpet. The brush bar is great for really getting dirt to come OUT of the carpet so the suction can get it. The attachments easily snap on (otherwise I know I'd lose them) and the hose/extension thing is very easy to use and put back.I don't really have any complaints per se, but I have to admit that I don't see how this thing cost almost $500. Don't get me wrong; it's by far the best vacuum I've encountered. But even at first glance, you can tell that the parts are typical cheap plastic. Nothing to write home about, and for that money, you'd expect sturdier-looking parts. It seems like this thing would get damaged very easily. I don't plan on tossing it down a flight of stairs, but it'd be nice to have something sturdier considering how much I invested in it.The only other thing I would suggest would be a retractable cord. I just hate wrapping that thing up every time.Overall, I do recommend this vacuum. It's a great product - just wish a little more attention to detail was evident!

I don't know what it is about the Dyson Animal Ball that makes it good for pet owners, but I do know that it gets up the hair - and that's where I find my money well spent.I won't go into great detail about why you should buy this vacuum. Instead I'll just explain why I gave it four stars and why I still think it's worth the money. Let's do this with the good 'ol pros and cons list.Pros:It sucks - literally. I did what I like to call 'the dark shirt test' - after I vacuumed my rug I rolled around on it wearing a dark shirt and checked to see how much dog hair was on me. None. My previous vacuum never passed the dark shirt test.The ball - what a genius idea. It makes the vacuum so much EASIER to maneuver - making it seem like less work to vacuum and *gasp!* fun.It is lighter (emphasis on the -er) than most vacuums.It has a small footprint making it easy to store in a closet and not take up all the floor space (in my closet anyway).Easy to get under low lying furniture.It has a reach wand and a neat little motorized brush attachment for stairs and curtains.Easy carpet to floor switch - no more having to turn off the vacuum and bend over to adjust the level, just press the button and it adjusts itself to go from carpet to hard floor in an instant.It has a warranty - this is my 3rd vacuum purchase in 6 years. It's nice to know that for at least the next 5 I won't have to buy another.Cons:The instruction manual leaves much to be desired. I had to find a youtube video to figure out how to get the wand out.The price - costing as much as a computer the cost is hard to swallow.Not as light as you expect - you will notice this if your house has 2 flights of carpeted stairs like mine.The wand is not as easy to use on the stairs as I thought it would be. The hose really requires some muscle to pull as you get further up the steps.The motorized brush is small and requires several swipes across each step. It also doesn't get into the corners and crevices of the steps where the dog hair likes to congregate. It can be hard to push across the carpet of the steps. If they had an another motorized brush attachment with a wider footprint I'd buy it and use that instead.The cord is short! Well, shorter than the cord on my previous vacuum. My rec room is quite large so I have to unplug and plug this cord back in a couple times to get the whole space vacuum.Overall, I recommend this vacuum if you are the loving owner of a notorious shedder like I am. I found it on sale so I don't regret spending the dough, nor do I think I would even if I had paid full price.

Tried the same test other reviews have mentioned - cleaned with my old vacuum, then went over the same places with the dyson. I was amazed at how much extra dirt and hair the dyson picked up.

The one that I have been using works fine, but it was just missing so much....I'd vacuum and when I was finished, it looked like I hadn't even started.  All that it did, it seemed, was moved the dirt from one area to another.  With four cats and a dog, I needed something that cleaned.Well the Dyson Animal dc25 arrived today via UPS. I had just finished vacuuming the entire house with the old vacuum cleaner, so I thought, what better time to test the Dyson.  Putting it together was a snap (or according to the directions a click).  Within 15 minutes, I had the Dyson out of the box and ready to use.  I only vacuumed the living room, hallway and kitchen and I am embarrassed to say that I almost filled the canister.  This vacuum really works!  If you're like me, have pets and have putting off buying this vacuum, don't wait any longer; it's worth every penny."

I insisted this was the gift I really wanted. You might ask.....A vacuum? for your birthday? Ok, so I like to clean. I am not a neat freak, but keeping my floors clean is important to me. We have 1 dog and he doesn't shed too much, but I vacuum about twice a week. We have a combination of laminate and tile and 1 large wool area rug in the living room. There's still carpet in 1 room, but will soon be replaced with laminate too. We will be adding 2 more area rugs in the near future. Once we complete our flooring, we will have laminate throughout with area rugs only.Getting the Dyson out of the box and putting it together is a story for another day, but when I arrived home from work yesterday, my wonderful husband had it put together. I'm sure it was easy. I was just super tired the night I tried it....I finally tried it tonight. First impression is how easy it is to maneuver vs. my heavy Kenmore upright. Now mind you I've been using a 6 gal shop vac to vacuum non carpeted (kitchen, bathrooms, laminate) flooring. The shop vac follows me around closely enough, but not too close and I could easily use the hose and wand to get into the corners and near the walls. A little barbaric perhaps, but I was content with it. I grew up in a house with a ton of animals and we vacuumed every day. We always used a shop vac because it was powerful and could pick up bigger items. My old upright is just too heavy to drag around the whole place and the piece that keeps it upright is broken, so it falls easily. I weighed it and it's 20lbs. but feels much heavier. The detachable hose is virtually useless since it's so short.So back to the Dyson. I was memorized by the commercials and the hose 'looked' easy to pull out and extend to a long length. And again, it is easy to maneuver. I'll give it that. Nice nd light to push around. What is different is that when I run it over my fairly thick wool area rug, I don't see any track marks, so I can't really tell where I ran over the carpet. I don't know if this is normal or not? I am used to seeing them with EVERY vacuum I've owned. I don't know if seeing the marks is a false sense of clean and they really aren't supposed to or need to be there or what. I'll have to research more I guess.So now the wand. I pulled it out and started to extend the hose. The vacuum was up my butt as I'm getting a work out trying to maneuver the wand around the room. I couldn't move very far without the vacuum following close behind because the hose was so tense. I assume this will get better over time, but I pictured myself with the vacuum in the middle of the room and myself prancing about the room with the wand and hose getting in the corners while the vacuum stayed put. I guess not :/So maybe I am being hard on the Dyson. Or maybe my expectations were a little higher since the vacuum is so darn expensive. I'll try it out for a couple of weeks and see if it's just a matter of getting used to it. I hope it gets better and the hose loosens up. Otherwise I may look at something else. Electrolux perhaps? Or maybe a canister vacuum?BTW, The vacuum wasn't purchased on Amazon. Without naming names, it was bought at that BBB place. ;) But I posted the review here because I love Amazon and do a lot of business here."

I have bought Hoovers, Eurekas, Orecks, Kenmores in my search for the perfect vacuum and I think I have finally accomplished my goal.  It picks up animal hair, dust, and dirt like none other.  The ball is very easy to maneuver and the canister is very easy to empty (except for the dust that flies up when you do).  I also love the multi-purpose onboard tools that don't take up a lot of space.  The only difficulty I have is with the removable stretch hose.  It seems a little short and the vacuum always tips over when I try to use it.  We have a lot of long hair in our family so hair does collect on the vacuum brush.  Fortunately, it is a snap to remove to clean.  This vacuum sucks up so much dirt and hair that you have to empty the canister and clean the brush pretty often.  That is a small price to pay for a clean home!"

Some of the pros:  It transitions from carpet to bare/wood floors without having to manually move a dial on the machine.  I found that switching from the canister to the tools was a bit akward at first but now I absolutely love how simple it is. The stair tool brings in air from the side of the unit, not from the front where the bristles are which means you get a lot more suction than other brands. The roller ball makes manuvering super easy.  The only cons (which are minor) are:  There is no place on the unit to store the stair tool (meaning I have to remember where I left it) and the on/off switch is in a bit of an inconvenient spot - it is not easy to just flip it on or off quickly.  I have not owned it long enough to confirm that it doesn't lose suction over time but I could tell immediately that it has more suction than any vacuum I've used previously. I would highly recommend the DC25 Animal."

The design of the vacuum makes it easy to use.  The tools also maintain powerful suction - something I've never experienced with other vacuums.  Our carpets looked new and felt new to bare feet after being vacuumed!  This has been my favorite part about the vacuum.  I have to be honest, I didn't know if paying this much for a vacuum was a good idea.  Now, I'm convinced I'll never buy a cheap vacuum again!  The feeling of clean is worth it to us.

Finally, my dreams came true and our crappy old Hoover started sparking and smoking!  I ordered the Dyson that night and could not be happier.  They work better than any other vacuum and are easier to use in general.  There's copy cats out there, but they are just cheap wanna-bes.  They do not have the technology of Dyson behind them and are light and flimsy.  This vacuum is not too heavy, but more-so better balanced so that it rolls perfectly and works with no effort.

It isn't great on hardwood - doesn't pick up the big stuff, and I've noticed that when going from hardwood to carpet, a lot of fuzz gets stuck to the bottom of the vacuum and comes off into the carpet.

The 5 year warranty made this decision a little easier. If a company is willing to warranty a product for 5 years, that must mean it is built to last. Other vacuums we owned in the past never made it past a year.What I like about this vacuum is how light it is. This is not heavy to carry up stairs, or from one room to another. It moves easily when in use, turns without any problems & gets into corners like nothing I've tried before. This vacuum sits low to the ground so it can fit under furniture that is raised up like a bed, chairs, and some places high enough for it. This does not take up a lot of space, so storage is easy.The canister is big enough for daily usage in my home, and we are amazed each time I run this through the house at how much stuff it pulls out of the carpets. The carpets look & smell clean after running the vacuum. I haven't used the attachments yet, but having them on board is such a convenience & they are not in places where they will fall off the machine, or get lost easily.Allergies are rampant in my home. We also have a large dog that frequently comes inside and was a problem before with all the shedding & dirt she brings inside. Now we do not worry, because this vacuum gets all the mess up easily & quickly.The day I bought this vacuum we ran out old one. Our old model is bag less, has a HEPA filter, & we thought was picking up all the dirt & hairs in our flooring. Right after running out old vacuum we ran the Dyson over the same floors & were amazed at how much the old one left behind. The Dyson picked up a powder substance from the flooring that we can only guess is dirt, or dust & hairs. We even commented on what we found as looking like the Dyson picked up pieces of the carpet itself, that's how strong the suction on this vacuum is.The price on these machines is high. I bought mine in a local store & paid much more than Amazon has this one for. If I had known about ordering it here I would have. I've seen the competitors vacuums & even owned a couple of them. They never lasted in my home longer than a year. None of them ever picked up all the dog hair, or allergens in my home either. I wanted to try a Dyson to see if all the people around me giving such great reviews was true & found out they are. Maybe this vacuum isn't for everyone's budget, or home. For me this was a lot less expensive than replacing a vacuum every 6 months to a year. If I can go at least 4 years without having to replace this Dyson, it will be worth every penny I paid for it.Hopefully everyone will have a good experience with this company & vacuum as I have."

In the past I have always gone to WalMart and bought a wind tunnel type hoover vacuum for under $100.  They did the job, but as of late my old vacuum just was not cutting it.  To have it repaired to its former glory would have cost $100, so I decided to invest in a new one.  There-go the Dyson Animal.Well I assembled my new vacuum today and did a test.  I sectioned my carpet into 3 sections and vacuumed only 1 of the three with my old vacuum. I then vacuumed another section of the carpet with only my Dyson.  To visualize you would see one stripe of non vacuumed carpet, another stripe vacuumed with my old vacuum, and the last stripe with my new Dyson.It was insane the visual difference in the carpet! The first section looked black that had not been vacuumed at all, the second looked grey, the third that was vacuumed with my Dyson was a rich burgundy red, the color of my carpet originally.  BTW I have 2 cats: my black and white cat sheds a ton, so what I was seeing was not dirt, but pet hair.I compared the pickup of each vacuum canisters and my old vacuum hardly picked anything up at all.  The Dyson on the other hand picked up three handfuls of pet hair!  I then vacuumed the stripe that was previously done by my old vacuum and it picked up another handful of pet hair.  That's insane - I vacuum 2x a week.Bottom line is when you go Dyson, you never go back - my old vacuum is going on Craiglist in the FREE section as I feel too embarrassed to ask anyone for money for it."

Its vaunted maneuverability is its best feature and maybe makes it worth the money. It weighs about what my old Dirt Devil ($75 from WalMart 10 years ago) but is so vastly more maneuverable that it takes much less energy to vacuum the whole house. I was afraid from other reviewers that the suction would be too strong and it would eat my rugs or pull threads from the carpets, but that is not the case. It does very nicely on the carpets and is kind to the Navajo rug. But the fluffy bathroom throw rugs it just doesn't do, period.My biggest problem with this vacuum is the attachments. The wand pulls out and the various attachments go on and off easily (with a satisfying 'click') but I think the designers were all 5'4' or less. The wand is too short, which makes using the (optional) floor tool very uncomfortable. I am 5'8' tall and I have to lean over to get the right angle for the floor. Also, the hose is too short and/or stiff to pull out far enough so the main unit follows right on my heels like a lonesome puppy. Perhaps that will improve over time as the hose stretches out.I have never had a 'good' vacuum before, but for the money I expected several magnitudes of improvement over the Dirt Devil and I just don't see it."

I was appalled at how much leftover dirt, hair and dust the dyson picked up on it's first run and would never go back to any other vac. The ball makes it super easy to get every inch of the floors and the fun attachments get into all the nooks and crannies which cuts cleaning time in half. I used to dread vacuuming the stairs but with the mini-head attachment my stairs have never been cleaner and I don't hate to do it anymore, I absolutely LOVE this vacuum!One tip: If you have as much hair in your home as I do, the dyson tends to clog up... it's easily fixable and won't cost anything because the dyson warranty is foolproof, but going through their customer service is not so fun. They wanted up to 7 weeks to fix it and send it back, I don't know about you but I usually vacuum 2-3 times per week so that was NOT an option for me!

I have friends (with animals) who have raved about the first Animal Dyson but I wasn't in the market for a new one at that time.  Now that I am a Dyson-owner, I wish I had gotten one sooner.  This new model is very easy to maneuver and you can watch the animal hair pile up right in front of you in the canister.  I find myself vacuuming more often now that I see there is new hair left on the carpeting daily.  The wand/attachment is not user-friendly but I've never found one that is on an upright.  It's a trade-off and I choose this vacuum for its power.The reason I gave the vacuum a less than stellar rating is the power switch.  I used it twice before it went out.  Dyson was good about taking care of it with the warranty but it was still a hassle to tote a new vacuum to the repair shop.  The repairman said he always keeps a supply of Dyson switches on hand as that is a quirk/weak area with them.  So be forewarned about that possibility.I am glad I have this vacuum now but if I had known about the switch problems beforehand, I might not want to spend that much money on a less than perfect machine."

It is worth noting that other than the color, the only difference from the All-Floors model is a pethair attachment. We have a golden retriever, but I have yet to use that attachment! If I had it to do over again I'd probably buy the all-floors model rather than the animal because it's less expensive and is the same vacuum minus the attachment I never use. But I would stick to the DC25 over the DC28.When I opened the package, which was beat up from shipping, part of the hose assembly had broken. Dyson has a 5-year warranty and they have their customer support line phone number right on the front of the vacuum! So I called, and the customer service guy was extremely helpful. I was having trouble explaining what was wrong, so he went and got one of theirs and compared it to what I was saying. They sent me a new part next-day mail! It was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had. I love that they have all their products hanging out near the support line and that they're so efficient with replacement parts. It's been a year (of very heavy use) and so far I haven't had to call them again.I have always hated vacuuming. The loud noise, heavy clunky vacuum, and broken belts/brushheads that stop turning. This vacuum is still loud, but is so easy to use and feels light. The brushhead stops turning only if I want it to!(There is a button to turn it off/it turns off when you pull out the attachment from the top). Even with my long hair and the dog shedding, I don't have to empty the cannister more than once while I'm vacuuming our large 3-bedroom home, vacuuming once a week. I also love that I have yet to smell that vacuum cleaner smell after I use it/while I'm using it, which must be due to the HEPA filter. It's worth noting other HEPA filter vacuums I've had did still manage to produce that vacuum, particles in the air, smell. My husband is happier now because he doesn't have to do all the vacuuming anymore!My neighbors and in-laws live close by and come by to borrow this vacuum all the time. It probably gets used every other day and has yet to have a problem.I was debating between this model, the all-floors, and the larger DC-28. If I had it to do over again I'd always pick the DC-25, simply for it's ease of maneuverability. It gets the job done very well, I don't find myself having to frequently empty the cannister, and it's so easy to push around! I have yet to find the cord much of a challenge, although I do have to unplug it and plug it back in every 2 rooms or so. The DC-28 is heavier and larger and therefore more difficult to maneuver."

It's much lighter than I expected.  I've owned canister vacs for years and I have to admit that it was nice not having to drag the canister around.  The Dyson definitely picked up a lot more dirt and cat hair than my canister vacs did.  I'm not loving the wand.  It's too long and very awkward to use.  The hose is too stiff to use the attachments comfortably.  This machine was obviously designed by someone who doesn't use a vacuum cleaner regularly.

After going through several vacumms in several yrs. we decided to bite the bullet and purchase a more expensive one.  It was easy to assemble but I prefer written rather than pictoral instructions and the instructions for using the attachments, emptying the canister, etc. could have been more explicit.  I thought my carpets were clean before testing it out but I was wrong; the canister quickly filled although it compacted the debris unlike any of my other machines.  Using a 'ball' rather than wheels too a few minutes to get used to. There is no obvious way to attach the pet hair cleaning tool to the vacumm for storage unless I have yet to discover where it goes and if there is not one this is going to be a huge challenge to keep it from getting lost or broken. This tool quickly and easily pulled the dog and cat fur off my furniture. I would have given this 5 stars but for the lack of a on-board storage place for the pet tool and the cost. This unit is also quieter and lighter than any others we have owned."

I have a 2-story home, myself and my husband are very active and we have two cats.*This Dyson is easy to maneuver and light which is great for stairs.  The design of the vacuum also allows you to lean the unit down under areas other vacuums cannot reach, for example under a dining room table or a piano.  To reach these areas with the Hoover I would need to use the hose extension.*I have had no issues with scratching the hardwood floors as other reviewers have mentioned.  The brush is turned off when I'm on hardwood.*The accessories are well-placed on the unit and are easily accessible and returned once you're done using them.*I don't have an issue with the canister becoming full frequently.  Each floor of the house (~1800sq ft) filled the canister to the full line and I vacuum weekly.  Many reviewers have said this was an issue for them- but even so the emptying of canister is a simple, straightforward and quick process.*The hose on the unit is not as flexible as I would like, but it may be a function of the unit being new and not having had time to stretch properly.*The attachment for pet hair works great!  We have microfiber couches and the attachment picks up the cat hair better than the lint roller I used to use.

He then demonstrated using my old Kirby versus my Dyson DC25.  He threw a handful of baking soda powder around my living room carpet and proceeded to vacuum with the Dyson for about 5 minutes (no joke).  He then went over it with the Kirby for about 20 seconds.  The result is completely astonishing.  The Kirby picked up at least 10 times more baking soda powder.  I honestly don't think I'd ever use anything other than a Kirby for the rest of my life now.I must have made the Kirby salesman mad because all he really did for me is convince me to use my old Kirby instead of my new Dyson.If you ever have a chance to see a live demo from a Kirby salesman, it will blow your mind.

One of my biggest problems is this old shag carpet that came with the house and someday will be replaced.  The suction is pretty good even with my shag.  The vacuum does not turn easily, but again, I think it is the shag, because of the suction.  It is much lighter than my Dirt Devil was and my 8 year old son likes to run it too.  I have a fireplace with actual bricks, a nightmare to keep clean.  To get the cobbwebs off, I had to use a brush, but with the attachment brush, the vacuum sucked everything right off without scatering it everywhere.  The attachments itself are more of a con rather than a pro.  Using the attachments turns into a chore by itself.  It took me a while to figure out how to put the attachments together.  There is no easy swapping, so I usually vacuum first, then change the attachment.  The hose is hard to use and seems short.  It takes some strength to pull the hose to use it where you want and stretch it out.  The cord is also shorter than on my Dirt Devil, so I have to change outlets more often.  The container is pretty easy to open, just push the button and the bottom opens up and most of the dirt falls out (most, because if you have animal hair, it may stick to the center and needs some additional attention). I empty the container outside, make sure to not stand against the wind.  In all I like the Dyson.  It does a pretty good job.  Was it worth the price....maybe not."

I am of small build (only 5'4' 104lb)and for the past year and a half have been a professional house cleaner for a local university, so I have used a professional model vacuum for comparison. I also used an older yellow colored model Dyson for cleaning a private account, and was so impressed by how powerful the suction was, but was disappointed with its bulky profile which made it hard to take out of its closet and lug upstairs.My 6 and 8 year old children were very enchanted with the new rolling purple ball design of the Dyson, which made them want to help Mommy. What a joy it was that all three of us could operate it with ease! They can even dispose of the contents when they are through with the push of a button.The down side was that the refurbished model Amazon first sent to me had issues. In fact, it was a lemon. With normal use and filter maintenance, the vacuum was weak. Amazon cheerfully agreed to send me another vacuum right out, giving me 45 days to return the old one. The new one came to us in 7 days (standard delivery). I have been quite pleased so far with the new one. It seems to work the way it should. It's operating sound is even different. When I cut the power, there is a distinct whistling sound as the suction dies down. Maybe its 'pneuma' or breath is returning to Dyson much the way our breath goes back to God when we die.:)I agree with the other reviews that the suction is superior to other brands in general, but you will not find the newer models to be as powerful as the older model DYSON vacs, which-while they are turned on and attached to a surface-are as stubborn  as octopus tentacles to release when an attempt is made. But to me it is worth having a little less suction if it means making this gem of a vacuum easier to lug around, especially if it has to travel upstairs. And wow! Is the newer ball model ever nice!

Morbid curiosity led me to empty the canister after each room to see where the worst of the dirt and hair had hidden from the Oreck.  Long hair from my daughters' shared bathroom was enough to burn out the belt repeatedly on the Oreck, but so easily removed from the brushes on the Dyson.

Needless to say, a vacuum that can handle all three of us shedding is essential.  I've gone through several vacuum cleaners over the years searching for a good solution.  I am loving this Dyson.  It's light weight but very powerful and easy to use.  It sucked up a full canister worth of gunk off a carpeted room I have vacuumed a day before with my old, obsolete vacuum.  Switching modes from hard-floors to carpet is an easy to reach button.  My downstairs is a hodgepodge open layout of solid wood floors and carpet so it's great to have one seamless cleaning device.  Switching to the accessories is easy, too.I had to clean the bristles after only a few rooms, but it wasn't too difficult.  It was mostly because my waist length hair tangles up easily.It is a little odd (but in a good way) to use the ball-design.  It turns so easily that the movements you may be used to on a regular 4 wheeled vacuum are no longer ideal.

We have all hardwood floors with large area rugs. The vaccuum certainly lives up to the hype and picks up all the hair on the rugs, which just helps to stop the tracking of hair everywhere else. However, I have noticed it doesn't work as nicely on the hardwood floors, and I would agree with another reviewer it does sometimes just blow the dog hair around. (I will continue to use my easier Swifter dust mop on the hardwood floors). The ball on the Dyson doesn't damage the hardwoods so that's a plus. I did take the vaccuum to my sister's place, she has different carpet, more like office building carpet and it didn't really pick up everything? I'm really not sure why. I still love the vaccuum because it does get all of our dog's hair and that's mainly what I wanted."

Every time you try to put it back you have to re-crinkle the tubing because otherwise it does not fit back where it is supposed to be.

After having a Kirby since 2000, and a Miele since 2002, we needed something to pick up the dog hair.  (One Akita, one lab, one rat terrier mix.)  Our vac's were NOT doing ANYTHING about the hair on the rugs and carpets.  Didn't matter how many times you went over it.Out of desperation, we ordered the Dyson DC25 Animal Ball from Amazon.  We clicked it together as soon as it arrived, and tested it in the worst room of the house.  In the first 5 ft. square area of carpet, we had to empty the overfilled canister.  (We didn't notice the 'max' line on it until later.)  We emptied the canister 7 times for this one room.  It picked up not only ALL of the dog hair, it picked up the nasty sediment that had worked its way into the bottom of the carpet without us being able to notice.  It was absolutely amazing, and the amount of grossness that it picked up was impressive.  The volume of dog hair vac'd up filled a tall kitchen trash bag up half way.  My husband and I just couldn't believe it.We also tested the mini brush tool on the first 3 steps of the stairs (also carpeted), and it FILLED the bin.  It is by far the best vac I've EVER used - mine or anyone else's!  Only one minor setback is the size of the canister/bin, but if you vac regularly, it shouldn't be much of a problem.  Especially when you compare it to the cost of filling up expensive Miele vac bags!"

The difference between the DC07's 38 foot cord and the DC25's 24 foot cord, is the difference between enjoying vacuuming and being annoyed by it.

It is very expensive but (hopefully) worth the $$$. I actually look forward to vacuuming now. As a floor vacuum (on carpet), it beats out my shop vac, and has become the best vacuum I have ever used. The suction is top notch. The handle is weighty, but doesn't hurt my wrists. I don't feel like I've done anything strenuous when I'm finished vacuuming. The Dyson was heavier than I expected, but easy to manuever from room to room. The cord is extra long and the vacuum doesn't usually roll over it, unlike another upright that I own and my shop vac. The filters look easy to clean. The dirt cup is easy to empty, so long as you hold it over the trash bin and gently tap it against the sides. (I found a swiffer duster handy to clean any remaining debris inside the dirt cup.) The vacuum is almost too easy to twist on the hard floors, so I think it does a much better job if you have carpeting, and the carpet looks like it has been vacuumed afterwards. I tested mine the first time just two days after using my other upright and was amazed at the amount of dust and dirt and who-knows-what-else it picked up. Now the hose: It may take some getting used to. The hose does seem the normal length to me, but it is very stiff. However, the vacuum does not fall over (like my other upright) when you fully extend the hose. I liked the benefit of having a handle on the hose but it also isn't a benefit if you need to vacuum something close to you, for instance, couch cushions. Fortunately, the handle can be disconnected and the hose used just like any other vacuum. Overall, I would say this is mainly a floor vacuum and best for carpet. For the quality of performance, I cannot give it less than 5 stars."

Purchased at BB and B for $319.00-included an in-store promo for 150.00 off plus a 20% off coupon.  Best deal I could find on a new one.  Not sure I would have paid full price for it.  The price I paid seems like a good deal for the vacuum.  Easy to assemble and did an amazing job cleaning area rugs, wood floors and berber style carpet.  WOW- would  give it a 5 star if that is all I had to vacuum.  Cleaned our thick/high pile carpet well, but does not fluff it at all.  I moved some furniture and usually use the vacuum to fluff up the carpet where the feet were- did not do anything.  Had to get the old hoover out to do this.  Carpet got very clean- much cleaner than from the old hoover, but did not look freshly vacuumed.  Felt like I needed to vacuum twice, once with the Dyson to clean and a second time with the old hoover to make it look refreshed.  Just finished doing the stairs- the telescope wand is really quite useless and awkward for this.  Ended up attaching the small roller brush directly to the hose and carrying the vacuum with me up the last half of the stairs.  Again cleaned great but no fluff- feel like I again need to redo with the old vac.  I do like the small hand held beater brush attachment- excellent for stair and furniture.  Cleans much deeper than the attachments on my old vac.  I do think the telescope wand will be useful for cleaning up high and down low (baseboards) just have not tried it yet.  Not sure the Dyson ball makes it much easier to use as the vacuum is a bit heavy and takes a lot of wrist action to turn it.  Emptying the canister is a snap- much easier than I thought it would be.  Highly recommend you empty it in trash bins outside.  Otherwise would be putting quite a bit of fine particle dust into the house.Cleaning power- 5 starPet hair- 5 starFluffing power- 0 stars(If you do not have high pile carpets- this could be a great vacuum for you- I would have given it a solid 4.5 stars if not for that)I think I would have bought the highly rated Hoover wind tunnel anniversary edition instead if it had not received such poor marks for reliability.  Though at $229.00 full retail- on sale for around 190.00- it is a cheaper way to go.  It did received the highest ratings from Consumer Report though they would not recommend it because of reliability issues- too bad."

This gets up pet hair, and messes left behind from two small kids. Sand, dust, dirt, and fuzz are no match for it.The canister dumps and attaches with a simple snap. You cannot ask for an easier way. My older cheap vacuum required it to be taken apart and it usually spilled more dust than I got in the trash can so this is a MAJOR plus for me. You have no idea!!I recommended this for my parents. They bought one and really love it.All in all, this is an extremely expensive vacuum. However I think it lives up to its expectations and I would definately buy again.

Hair everywhere!  It was as though my vacuum hadn't sucked up anything (despite it being less than 2 years old).  After doing considerable research on various models and reading customer reviews, I decided to spend more than I had initially prepared myself to spend and buy the DC25 Animal - and I haven't regretted it for one moment since! My place feels infinitely cleaner since buying this vacuum.To address a couple of the concerns raised in several reviews I read prior to purchasing: the size of the receptacle and the ease of assembly.  The size of the receptacle is more than adequate and the ease with which it can be emptied would offset its size even if I had found it to be on the small side.  With one hand and a light tap against the rim of the garbage can, it was empty.  Additionally, assembly took me (literally) 5 minutes - it's extremely easy.I would recommend this vacuum to animal owners without hesitation.Pros:SuctionEase of assemblyProduct weightManeuverabilityCons:Definitely on the expensive side (but, as I said, well worth it)"
"634","XX","B001EFMD8W","1.0","April 7, 2011","A3RRKQ8RIJ6VMY","An overpriced, overhyped, underperforming piece of crap","At the urging of a close friend's wife, who has one, I bought a DC25. She raved over how easy it was to use, how it never needed a bag changed, and how well it 'sucks up everything but the color out of the carpet!'.  I used it for a month, trying to be generous and give it the benefit of the doubt.  After a month of putting it through every pace I can think of, here's my conclusion...It's junk.  Crappy, expensive junk at that.1) It doesn't 'suck up everything but the color out of the carpet'.  In fact, the only thing about it that sucks is how poorly it performs in light of the marketing claims.  Yeah, you can see stuff swirling in the canister.  Big deal.  Problem is there's a whole bunch of that same stuff it left in your carpet.  The hose from the beater head to the dustbin is way too small, the suction motor is puny, and the beater head is, at best, vestigial.  Overall the thing just doesn't work well.  Period.  The 50 yr old Kirby I inherited from my grandmother could suck this thing back through its own hose. (More on that hose later...)2) 'You never need to change a bag!'  Sure, but you have to take a shower every time you empty the dustbin.  Want to know what it's like to empty the thing?  Get a half gallon pitcher, fill it 1/3 full with pastry floud and 10X (very fine) powdered sugar.  Now try to pour it into a trash can or dumpster without the poweder flying everywhere and sticking to everything.  That's what emptying this damnable canister is like.  And that's AFTER you figure out how to get the rickety, frustrating latching mechanism to work.3) All the attachments are onboard.  Correct, they are.  The procedure for getting the hose uncoupled and attached to the 'extension wand' (the handle, which you have to pull out of the machine) is just as complex as switching from the beater head to the hose on the afotermentioned Kirby.  It's no advantage other than having it right there and not having to walk the ten feet to the closet to get the hose.  Big friggin deal.  And the attachments don't work all that well anyway because the vacuum not only has no suction, it also moved no air. (see item #1 above)  Which brings us to...4) The attachment hose.  Yeah, it's onboard.  Yeah, it's convenient to pull out and hook up.  It's also un-reinforced along its length and is CONSTANTLY trying to collapse back into its unextended state.  In other words, the thing is always fighting you.  If you pull the hose out to its full length and let got it instantly snaps back into the collaped position, and with a fair amount of force, too.  It pulls the vacuum around after you like some way-to-friendly dog that's forever underfoot or right in your face. On a hard floor I can't even get the hose to extend unless I physically restrain the vacuum in some way.  Even then the hose is trying to pull itself back to the vacuum all the time, making using the hose-end attachements that much more frustrating, scooting the vacuum over to you, or tipping it over.5) The Dyson is light and easily maneuvarable.  Yes, it is, but so is my bedside trash can.  And the trash can holds more and is easier to empty.6) The heavy duty motor pulls 11 big amps!!  Yeah, and?  I can pull a full 15 amps by shorting the cord.  So?  How much power the motor uses has exactly zilch to do with how the vacuum performs.I tried.  I really did.  I went through all the motions for a month hoping I was doing something wrong and wanted to justify the price and the hype.  But in the end the Dyson simply didn't live up to the marketing.  It's a product made for being pretty on TV first and performing second (or maybe third, fourth, or fifth, for that matter).  It just doesn't work well at all.  I ended up selling it on Craigslist and getting a reconditioned Kirby G5 for the same money.  Yeah, it's heavier and I have to carry an attachment or two around with me, but it actually WORKS!!  If it lasts as long as the one I got from Gramma (which still works like a champ) then I'm money wayyyyyyyy ahead."

I can honestly say that I will never be without one again.  It is powerful, without being heavy, and the ball technology makes it so easy to maneuver.  I have bad back problems, and usually have to take several breaks when I vacuum my carpet and linoleum, or tile.  Not with this machine.  It is so powerful, that I do not have to continually go over the same spot, and it gets the job done without being so heavy that it hurts to pick it up or maneuver it.  It is so easy to empty the canister, and I'm still amazed at what it manages to pick up.  I thoroughly vacuumed prior to using the Dyson (DC25) and was mortified when I saw how much more it vacuumed up.  I don't care how many times I empty it, because I realize how much cleaner my home is becoming. I can go from carpeting to tile without sending dirt 'flying' if I forget to turn off the 'beater brush' - it is all picked up and contained.  We live in the country, with many various types of poultry, fowl, equine, and our indoor cats and dogs.  There is no telling what is being tracked into my home, as my husband isn't very careful about removing his shoes or boots.  I no longer worry about any of this, because my Dyson Animal will take care of it.I always thought that buying a Dyson would be a big 'splurge', and could not possibly work so much better than other vacuums, or be worth the extra money. I regret wasting time not having one. I regret buying all the bags and belts for all my other machines.  I regret buying all the other machines - period. After much research, I convinced my husband that we needed to at least try it out and found the best price on Amazon.com.  We are both in complete agreement that it was actually a very wise purchase, and wish we'd done it much sooner. I do not have to spend as much time vacuuming over and over, and I appreciate the fact that I know it will take care of the toughest jobs.

The removeable handle attachment allows me to reach and clean my ceiling without breaking my back. You can even turn off the brush spin for smooth floors (Screw sweeping, you no longer need to!). This vac is so light that I am surprised there is an even lighter compact model available.The only cons I could barely conceive of are the small size of the canister and the way the long handle rests on the hose a little when you use the hose without it. But the funny part about these cons are that the canister is so easy to empty it takes you less than a minute and you can go back to vacuuming (secondly my carpet was REALLLY dirty). You are able to retrieve any items you may inadvertently suck up when you do this (like one of my favorite earrings and a mousy cat toy eheh..) Also, the handle doesn't really effect the way the hose is able to suck up pretty much everything.There's so much more, but best of all my boyfriend now thinks its awesome to clean with this vacuum (because it looks cool and works so well) so, now I have to wait to have a turn to use it.The Dyson DC25 Animal is definitely worth the money, especially since this vacuum even has a 5 yr warranty with Dyson. I will never buy another cheap department store piece of junk that I would have to spend the same amount of money to replace every year, buy replacement filters for, buy bags for, buy stinky rubber belts for, or...etc.Simply Dyson all the way! (Sarcastically: Wow, Engineering works!)"

I had a 5 year old Bissell that definitely needed to be maintained after every use.  However we have 4 cats and plush carpeting.  This performed miracles!  I couldn't believe how nice it made the carpets look and how much ended up in the canister.  I had read reviews about other possible heavier Dysons and I think this is perfect.  It is easy to put together out of the box and very easy to maneuver.  It also did great in the bathroom where we have the litter box and linoleum flooring.However, I got the biggest kick out of my bathroom mats that look so flat after a short time and a few washings. It puffed them right back up and got the typical lint out of them.  I highly recommend this product for cat owners!"

Anytime I have had problems I simply call the Dyson customer service and the helpful people talk me right through it (I must mention all my problems were user error, not mechanical). My husband once used it to suck up water off the carpet, I was worried that he had ruined my very expensive vacuum, but even doing that the vacuum still runs like new!I have a big fluffy long-haired German Shepherd and this vacuum does the trick keeping my house nice and fur ball tumbleweed free. The attachments are great, but I don't think they are worth the extra $60 for the Dyson animal. I use them but not enough to justify the extra $60.I have a lot of hardwood and this vacuum is great on the hardwood as well as the carpet.The ball was a little tricky to get used to, but now that I am I love the ball and could never go back to stationary vacuums.

This is very noticeable when you remove and empty the canister. Also, the telescopic hose is difficult to use on a staircase, since it wants to recoil once stretched out so you have to brace the vaccuum against something.

"651","XX","B001EFMD8W","1.0","March 13, 2011","A1C24C20CKFOFA","Could be better... a whole lot better","After 15+ years of having a Kirby, which worked great but weighed a ton, I was happy to get the Dyson. We have dogs and kids, so our vacuum gets daily use. At first I was thrilled, mostly with the lighter weight. But over time some big flaws have come to light that make me miss the Kirby which still works, but the power drive is broken so it burns the motor to use it for too long - otherwise I'd go back to it for better cleaning. Here are the issues with the Dyson. The cord is way too short, the hose is way too short, the hose suction is terrible, the attachments that come with it are completely useless, and it's worthless on hard floors. I'm torn on the bagless concept. On one hand it's great not to have to deal with bags. On the other it's a dusty mess that requires more cleaning to keep it semi-decent. The lack of a belt also has it's downsides. If you don't clean the Dyson roller after every use then it grinds down the spinning post in the head with no warning until it's gone. The only fix is to replace the entire head at $100+. It doesn't stop working or warn in any way that the head is sticking. And it doesn't take long for it to grind up. I really like to use hose attachments for dusting and the puny attachments that come with it are absolutely worthless. I took my Kirby dusting attachment and crammed it onto the Dyson crevice/dusting device. The little spinning head attachment just gets almost immediately crammed up with hair. Just one more roller to clean. And the hose suction isn't enough to make it spin once it gets a few hairs on it. We moved from a place that was mostly carpet to all hard floors and now I'm really, really not liking the Dyson at all. Turning off the roller for hard floor use just makes it blow dirt around and gunk up the roller with whatever sticks to it in the attempts to get sucked in. The thing can't get under furniture at all. The hose is the only way to clean a hard floor and without a flat head to dissipate the suction it's useless. So now we're expected to spend another hundred bucks to get a decent floor attachment and dusting attachment. But dumping more money into it doesn't address the ridiculously short hose. The short cord I could deal with annoying as it is, but with a hose that short you pretty much have to carry the main vacuum around with you or it's pulling around and tipping over. In that little product pic for using the hose they should add a ghost image of it slamming the lady in the back of the legs. On steps you must carry it even on a smaller staircase. Now we have a long steep 'old house' staircase, so the short hose and short cord work together for supreme frustration and potential deadliness because we must do half the staircase (carrying the thing) then unplug, replug, and do the other half (still carrying the thing) which is less than stellar on a steep wooden staircase. Add to that the fact that the only 'handle' is the one on the canister which makes for barrels of laughs when you accidentally hit the button and spill dirt everywhere while you're cleaning.All in all, I was very excited to get a Dyson - but for such a hyped and pricey product they really could have done a better job with the design and included attachments that actually work instead of making people dish out even more money to make it into a remotely functional product. I would not buy another nor recommend it to anyone. And I'm really hoping it has mortal issues soon (perhaps involving a steep staircase) so I can replace it with something that works. The Kirby did cost more and was cumbersome, but it was a great workhorse that not only came with a super long cord, super long hose (that you have to remove the head to attach) and good attachments, but it also came with a shampooing unit. And it didn't blow dirt and dust around like the Dyson. And it went almost flat to get under furniture. I'd probably go with a canister next time to get the maneuverability and light weight along with working attachments. Dyson is not worth the price.Update: A couple of months after writing the original review, I bought an Electrolux Ultrasilencer Green canister vacuum from Amazon for less than $200. It gets run every single day (often multiple times/day) and is still wonderful over a year later. It's much quieter with better suction than the Dyson, lightweight, has great attachments (I can dust with it!), does an acceptable job on area rugs, and the hose and cord are of adequate length. On the stairs, it is light enough to easily carry. The hose reaches about 2/3 of the way without carrying it, but with the cord length I can do the whole staircase from one outlet with no problem. It has no spinning brush, so is perfect for hard floors. The Dyson has been relegated to the screened porch where I use it to clean the indoor/outdoor rugs. I use the hose on the bricks and have noticed that it's been getting progressively more difficult to pull the hose out. Needless to say, I'm glad I got a new vacuum!"

It is expensive,but if you want a vacuum that picks up the dirt and pet hair then spend the money.The wand is kind of quirky,the cord could be a little longer and the tools are on the cheapy side. These things I can get used to. The only thing is, I hope it last at least 13 years.

I've used it twice in the three days Ive had it and it is VERY easy to life up and dwon stairs, and does a great job and getting under and around furniture.I have hardwood floors and dog (Weimaraner).  She does not shed alot, but I do find small clumps of dog hair.  The Dyson does a great job of picking these up and smaller items up.  Much better than the Eureka.  The ball kicks out some air, and will blow dust and hair around a little bit, but you can always go back over that spot and get them, not a big deal.Negative.The only negative comment I have is the build quality.  It does seem fragile, and there is a plastic part that you step on to get the vacuum to work.  I need to remind myself to be gentle with this as I am not sure how well this will hold up over the long term.Canister size.  The canister is a little on the small size and needs to emptied fairly often (every two vacuums probably).Price. I do think Dyson products are grossly overpriced.  It does seem to work as advertised, but $400.00+++ for a vacuum is outrageous.  The only way that price is justifiable is if this thing still works ten years from now the way it works now."

It also goes right along the wall really well.  The one thing I would like to tell people is the $40 more you are paying is only for one attachment.

Cleaning the tank is simple and by emptying it after each use there is no more stale smell when vacuuming.My home has both carpet and hardwood flooring, by switching the beater bar to 'off' I can easily continue moving from one surface to another.  Having had my Dyson Animal for just over a month now, and vacuuming weekly at minimum, I can honestly say that this was a truly good purchase.  I have, and will, recommend this machine to anyone.

What a disappointment.  The bin is small so I have to empty it several times while vacuuming just one room.  After six rooms this is getting old running back and forth to the trash container.  And what a mess that process is.  Dust flies up while I empty the bin and it never seems to be dust free after dumping either, leaving a fine residue on your hands, the middle of the ball, and the bin.  At first I was impressed with how much dust and hair I collected, but this is probably no more than my old cleaner with a bag that didn't let me see how much I had vacuumed, but still produced a full bag.  It appears there is good suction, yet not enough to pull the nap of the carpet up, so although it may be clean and animal hair free, it is becoming increasingly more matted down, giving the impression of worn out carpet.  I attribute this to no setting, such as high or low plush.  I didn't have this issue with my old Hoover that left track marks where the nap was lifted, something I particularly like seeing.  My last complaint is the short cord that doesn't reach far enough and doesn't retract."

I am so impressed.  It is amazing what this pulls out of your carpets.  I got out a lot of that carpet powder that I assumed had been vacuumed up every time I applied it - not so at all.  It is also the best edge cleaning vac that I have ever owned.  The first night that I owned it, it accidentally sucked up a penny (using the flatout floor attachment) in a flash.I'm impressed with the brighter appearance of the carpet and the soft feel of the carpet when I'm in bare feet.I love the 'engineering' aspects of the cleaner - the way the wand pulls out from the handle and you can choose the firm wand or detach the flexible hose part to use the attachments.  Also, the quick way that the beater brush can be removed to clean off 'wraparounds' is great.  It is very lightweight for all that power - I couldn't believe the difference when I moved my Hoover Mach 5.  The removal and re-insert of the dust bin is so easy.Attachments that I got that are great- the flatout floor tool allows you to go far under tables, chairs, beds without moving them - it retains the suction power of the unit itself.- the soft dusting brush (purchased separately here @ a 10$ discount from any other site) will be great for louvers, panelled furniture, etc.- stiff bristle brush for 'scrubbing' at tough, dried in spots- long flexi tube crevice brush AND a standard size crevice tool that lets you choose brushed or plain end.I found the instructions amazing - just illustrations and arrows that were very easy to comprehend and follow.What I will miss- the cord doesn't retract or doesn't have that little loop on the back of the handle to hold it out of the way while you vacuum- the flexible hose for the attachments is a bit unweildy, but considering that it is such a large diameter to assist with cleaning, I'll learn to live  with it.- not much on board storage for attachments, but again this will keep the entire unit more lightweight for use, so I'll learn to love it.I've only had this a few days and I am really loving this already."

I have seen Dyson vacuums in stores so I knew what I was getting style wise, it's a sleek machine. I had no major difficulties attaching the necessary parts and had it up and running rather quickly. I was surprised to discover that only 2 attachments fit on the side, for some reason I thought there would be a place for each attachment. They sent me a few extras, some I may never use, and I have put them in a bag I will carry with me from room to room.I vacuumed my living room and could not believe the amount of dirt that filled the canister. I wonder if my old vacuum worked at all. It has very strong suction, which is one of the reasons I bought it. I had a little trouble opening the canister and actually opened the top part not realizing the bottom flipped open if the right button was pushed. I figured out how to open the bottom and the dirt fell into the trash. The only downside to this is that some dust flew up into the air, but that also happened when I removed the full bag from my old vacuum. I like that you can empty the canister after each vacuum and the get the dirt out of the house, no need to worry if the bag is full. I will have to get used to vacuuming with the hose, it's not as flexible as my old one, but I can deal with it.By the end of the day I had vacuumed most of my house and found myself vacuuming in places I normally skip ( behind the couch) just so I could see how much dirt I could pick up. I'm sure that is just a temporary thrill of having a new vacuum that out preforms my old one. I am very happy and though it may sound odd~ I can't wait to vacuum again."

I know I've read reviews before that have said this...but if you're sitting there wondering if you should spend all that money...do it!!  I was just like you...buying sweepers that were about half this much, bags, bagless, hoping to find a good one but always being disappointed.  This sweeper delivers.  It came in about four pieces and I (a girl) was able to put it together fairly easily ;)  I think the hardest part was trying to figure out where the attachments went and how to get them on and off...but once I figured that out I was in business.  It has great suction power for carpets but not so much that you can't do area rugs without it trying to suck them up.  I don't know how they do that but it's great!  The part that surprised me the most was when I turned off the beater brush for carpets and continued on to hard surfaces...it didn't lose any suction power!  Emptying the collection bin is very easy and hardly any mess.  Only thing you have to do to maintain the sweeper is clean the filter with water occasionally and maybe take it apart and use a hair hose to blow out the dust that might collect in it...that's it.  And as for the ball technology...well, I don't even know where to begin.  It's fantastic!  My nine year old son even thinks it's fun to sweep now to see how he can spin around things..lol.  The only draw back for this machine that I can see is it is a little on the small side.  So I could see if you live in a large home it might take longer to sweep your house than with a larger vacuum.  But my house is small, about 800 sq.ft., and it's perfect.  In fact, I think it takes me less time to sweep because I can easily go around all the things in my home.  It's also very easy to carry around.  My only request to improve this sweeper would be to somehow find a way to hold the extra attachments that you can get with the sweeper.  Mine came with three and that's all you can carry with you."

The maneuverability/flexibility took a few minutes to get used to, but it is a huge improvement over the older model.  also, the extension wand just telescopes straight out, I don't have to flip it around like I did on my older vacuum.  I am pretty happy with the newer improved Animal. Keep 'em coming, Dyson!"

I replaced a sofa and love seat of a sofa/love seat/chair/ottoman set that I loved because my old vacuum cleaner could not get the hair off.  I kept only the chair and ottoman but I hid them in the back room so no one would see them because I couldn't get them clean.The Dyson pulled off every single hair...you can't tell an animal was ever on them.  It makes less noise than my other vacuum cleaner and is so lightweight that I don't mind using it. Did I mention the air?  No kidding...it actually feels cleaner when I breathe!  And it does a great job on the floors as well -- carpet, hardwood and tile. I love the ball-drive, too -- no more wrestling with the old stick shift.My favorite chair and ottoman are in the middle of the livingroom again.  Had I only known what this vacuum cleaner could do, I'd still have my sofa and love seat, too. How much cheaper it would have been to buy a Dyson than to replace furniture! It makes me sad I didn't do this sooner."
"673","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","January 28, 2011","A1RSAZ8GDYBU47","Absolutely worth the cost.","Because I could gush on about this vacuum forever, I'll start with a list of pros and cons to organize things a bit:Pros:The ball technology really is magnificent.Weight/size of the vacuum doesn't sacrifice quality.It sucks - really! The suction cannot be beat here.No replaceable belts, filters, or gadgets to mess with - low-maintenance in every sense of the word.Overall ease of use is superb.Cons:The cord is way too short.No fancy device that winds/sucks up the cord for you.Pricey, and rarely goes on sale (but well-worth it).Honestly, those are the only cons I've been able to come up with as of yet, and the last one isn't even really a con.  After lusting over the Dyson for years, my husband finally agreed to buy me one as an early Christmas present during our Black Friday shopping trip (we paid $100 off the list price at Target at $449). I had built this vacuum up for so long in my head that I was deathly afraid of being disappointed, but I haven't been yet.The size of the Dyson is a dream. You don't strain yourself lugging a 50 lb. vacuum out of the closet, or up the stairs.  It's light but powerful, quiet (at least compared to my last vacuum) and easy to push around.  The attachments are spectacular, easy to use and work well on cleaning furniture/reaching tight spots, etc.I chose to get the Animal because we have a dog who lives primarily outside, but when she does come in, sheds like you wouldn't believe.  This vacuum has the capacity and suction to get every last dog hair off the carpet and the kitchen floor.  The function that turns off the brush is a dream - whenever I tried to clean bare floors with my old vacuum, it would generally just blow the dog hair around the room.  The Dyson's suction combined with the ability to turn off the brush is tremendous.Dyson recommends a 'maintenance plan' of washing the vacuum's two filters once every three months.  They even send you an email as a reminder, and though I've only had to wash mine once since I've had the appliance, they were hardly even dirty (my old vacuum's filter had to be washed after every use, or the hose clogged - it seemed the majority of the dirt ended up in that half-inch of foam rather than in the dust bin itself).As for the cons, I've read some reviews complaining about the size of the bin.  I don't have a big house - about 1300 sq feet - but I can vacuum the whole place without emptying the bin once.  Unless you live in a large house, the size of the bin shouldn't be a huge problem.  Also, the hands-free emptying ability makes the chore incredibly easy, anyway. My only real complaints about this vacuum involve the cord.  I feel that it's much too short to be convenient - I usually have to unplug and replug two or three times just to get my living room done. Also, I was very surprised there was no function for winding/sucking up the cord hands free.  Neither issues are deal breakers, it just seemed to me that a company that relies so much on convenience and ease of use for their products would have remedied this.I'm of the firm opinion that, in something like a vacuum, you get what you pay for. Sure you can get a lot of sub-par vacuums for $100 or less. They get the job done, but for something you use every week at the very least, a product's quality speaks volumes.  The Dyson has a 5 year warranty, and will undoubtedly last much longer than that in great shape.  My old $200 vacuum more or less kicked it after 2 years, and gave me countless headaches long before that.If you have kids, pets, live in a dusty area, or just like a impressively clean house, the Dyson is completely worth its price tag."

I am always unplugging the unit and replugging it somewhere else.-The hose is way too short and way too tight.  Everytime I go to use the hose with any attachments, I end up fighting with my Dyson.  It has good reach but you must keep your foot on the unit itself so it does not spring back and hit you in the ankles.  The coiled hose is extremely tight and hasn't stretched at all in the last 6 months.  This is very painful....IT HAPPENS EVERYTIME I USE IT!  I feel like I need to wear my boots everytime I vacuum.-The canister is very small.-Takes some getting used to pushing the unit around with the ball.-Does it suck better than my last $100 unit that lasted 10 years?  Absolutely not.  In fact, it has a lot less suction but I don't have the pet odors to deal with.Was it worth it for the money?  That depends on how long it lasts.  I used to feel good after vacuuming because I felt my old vacuum did a great job.

I gave it two stars for two reasons. One, it is lightweight enough to carry up and down the stairs easily. Two, the ball feature does add great maneuverability. My two biggest complaints concern the accessory tube and the emptying of the collection bin. The accessory tube fits inside the handle and every single time I have used it I feel like I'm going to break it and it is pain in the butt to wrestle with it. (Husband feels the same way)  I feel like I'm fumbling and there is nothing intuitive about it. It makes me avoid using the accessory hose/ tube attachment, to the point that now I have apparently forgotten how to get it out. I'm doing everything I thought was the process: flip the red lid, pull out the tube, press the button and pull but nothing is happening. My second issue with it is that not once have I emptied it when I didn't have to stick my hand into it to get the stuck hair out of it, even when I make certain that the crud is far below the maximum level. Yuck! A secondary complaint of mine is that I don't like the lines it puts on the carpet. One stroke leaves multiple lines the carpet not one wide swath like we're used to and that can be vacuumed 'out' so that it isn't noticeable. It sounds like it shouldn't be a big deal but it bugs me every time I use it."

I bought it because I have a yellow lab and keeping up with the dog hair and mess was very important to me.  At first, it had great suction and I felt it did a great job.  Then I noticed that even though it had great suction on my carpets, it wouldn't pick up the smallest pebble on my hardwoods.  I would have to use the handle to get the small items on the floors.  It is heavy so not a practical machine to use on the stairs and forget about the small tools.  In fact, I doubt I have used any of the accessories more than once because it soon became more work and they didn't really perform as well as they should.  I've already had it in for repairs and now there appears to be another issue with the suction and I may have to take it back again.I am frustrated with the performance, weight and how little the canister holds.  Like all new machines, it worked great the first year or so and now, it is just as disappointing as those other machines, except I paid a lot more money for this one.  The suction was great in the beginning but after a few years is only average, just like any other vaccuum I've had in the past."

That evening I had a reply from amazon.  They shipped me another dyson AND shipped it overnight.  As far as I know, the other one is still lost somewhere at ups.  Now for the dyson.  It is all it claims to be.  My favorite feature is how easy it is to empty the canister.  Since I have a two story house, I also bought the Hoover wind tunnel retractable.  The first time I emptied it, I had to pull the canister apart and use my hand to unwind the dog hair.  With the dyson, it is really as simple as pushing the button that opens the bottom and giving it a few shakes.  For me, that alone is worth 300 extra!  The ball really does make it easier to use...especially around objects.  I am not totally in love with the wand piece but I think I understand why they did that and you do learn to use it."

Takes the chore out of vacuuming!!!","Purchased the animal ball with a little hesitation about the price (it's almost $600!!!) and whether the DC28 or DC25 would be right for my house. Most of the reviews said that the DC25 was useless on thick carpet and better for hard floors, however our house has both carpet and hard wood floors! In the end I ordered the Animal Ball DC25 and I am COMPLETELY satisfied! It does an amazing job with pet hair (no more chasing around the fur bunnies that would scatter when my other vacuum came near!) AND, vacuuming the carpet was easy! I used to have to vacuum 2x a week, but with the dyson I have only vacuumed once in a week and a half. Amazing!The best thing that I have discovered about the vacuum is the attachments. It is so easy to switch from vacuuming to using an attachment with out skipping a beat. The traditional narrow tube that cleans corners also has a bristled head that slides down so you can do the baseboards while vacuuming the carpet! Amazing!I also found the vacuum suction strong enough to dust the tops of dressers and blinds! Score!!!"

My Dyson and I got off to a rough start last night.  I had vacuumed my whole place and couldn't figure out why the bin barely had anything in it.  I was fuming mad and put the Dyson into time-out for the evening.  Apparently I had unknowingly popped the cap on the wand and subsequently didn't realize all the suction was coming through the wand.  Second try was a charm today!(3) The wand is extremely awkward to use and is very limiting.  It definitely needs to be redesigned to build in some kind of flexibility.

"683","XX","B001EFMD8W","2.0","January 16, 2011","A3MI07IFK5LYJI","OK on carpets, no good on wood floors or with attachments","Summary: OK if all you want to do is vacuum carpets, but not good on wood floors or with attachments.There have been many positive reviews so I will focus on the negative aspects of this product that, every time I use it, makes me wish I had not bought it. I was attracted to the Dyson Ball due to the clever advertising and the many positive reviews.  We have pets and I chose this particular model for the mini turbine head attachment to clean pet hair on the furniture and because it was lighter weight than other Dyson animal models. Our house is about half carpet and half hardwood floors. As a carpet vacuum it works well enough but not any better than others I have owned or used that are significantly less expensive.  The ball design, once you get used to it, does make the vacuum very maneuverable but I've never really had a problem with maneuvering a standard vacuum so this seems to be solving a non-problem. The vacuum is not so great on wood floors. The ball is a disadvantage on hard floors. There are exhaust vents on the ball and when vacuuming hardwood floors the exhaust air on the rotating ball tends to blow light weight debris, such as pet hair, away from the vacuum so it never vacuums it up. The attachments are the worst aspect of this vacuum. The flexible portion of the hose has a very strong internal spring so that it stores properly back into the handle. The combination of the spring and vacuum suction is so strong that if you try to stretch it out more than two or three feet it just drags the vacuum along with it or tips it over. It is extremely tiring to use attachments due to the strong force of the spring and the suction pulling back. I thought it would get better over time but after 2 years of use it is no better. The rigid portion of the hose is about 3 feet long and includes the handle making it ungainly to use. I've tried detaching it but then you have to stretch the flex hose out even further which increases the spring force even more. The mini turbine head is marginal at best. The rotating bristles on the head are widely spaced resulting in it cleaning narrow parallel lines and requiring many passes to properly clean furniture. That combined with the problem with the hose tension make using it a major chore. Much better is my 15.6 V cordless Shark hand held vacuum with motorized brush. For less than $50 it cleans better, faster and infinitely more conveniently. For things where I need attachments such as cleaning stairs etc, I've reverted to my old, less than $100, Bissell. Its suction is not as good but at least it doesn't fight me the entire time.  The net result is I never use the attachments anymore; it's just too much work. Following are a few more annoying traits. The dust canister is very small and usually requires emptying once or twice if I am vacuuming the whole house. Also carpet fibers and pet hair tend to mat inside the canister so you have to reach in and pull it out. Not pleasant. I empty the canister long before the full mark, but it still happens. When the rotating floor brush is on, the high pitched whine is so loud and piercing it hurts my ears. All in all, I wish I had been smart enough to return the vacuum shortly after purchase. The return shipping cost would have been a small price to pay to eliminate the aggravation I feel every time I use this vacuum."

I did the 'dyson challenge' and vacuumed with my Bissel Healthy Home first and then went back over it with the dyson and I have to be honest... there was VERY very little that the dyson picked up after my Bissel- I was honestly really disappointed- I wanted to have to empty the bin 2-3 times like others did and really feel I got my moneys worth... BUT after owning it for several weeks now... I JUST LOVE the convenience of it!! the 'Ball' really is a great feature- It fits in places my other bulkier bissel just cant AND IT MOVES FROM CARPET TO TILE TO MY AREA RUGS with NO effort at all!

So I got a new one - same problem.So I tried the Dyson cannister and hated it.  I tried 7-8 other vacuums, the usual suspects (Bissell, Hoover, Shark, etc.) and never got anything that worked better than just mediocre.  Nothing could handle pet hair like my old DC17 - with 2 dogs, 3 cats and a 5 year old, Dyson set the bar too high and nothing else came close.Then I saw this DC25 Animal and decided to give Dyson another try.  It's wonderful!  Last night I went over my area rugs and there were no problems, not to mention how much dust and other nastiness the DC25 sucked up just 24 hours after I had vacuumed with my Shark.

I have a 1 year old Golden Retriever and purchased a house with a black tile floor in the kitchen (a bad decision on my part).  I have been fighting dog hair and mud for the last year: in the kitchen, in the carpet, on the furniture, near the air vents, etc.  I purchased a new Hoover Windtunnel about nine months ago, but it did not seem to make much of a difference.  After reading several reviews on the Dyson Animal, I decided to put it on my wedding registry.  Last weekend, I received it from my friends at a shower.  I was curious whether it would live up to its reputation, so I ran the Hoover Windtunnel over an area rug and then ran the Dyson over the same rug.  I was DISGUSTED by all the Dyson picked up.  I literally had to empty the Dyson as soon as I was finished vacuuming one area rug because the cansiter was full of dust, dirt, and doghair (this is the same area rug I had JUST vacuumed with my Hoover about 5 minutes prior).  I know this is a very expensive vacuum, but it is completely worth the price.  While I received it as a gift, now that I've seen it in action, I would purchase it for myself tomorrow.  There is literally no comparison between my Dyson and my $250 Hoover.  The Dyson's force is so strong it almost picked the area rug off the floor, but it never once got the rug caught.  My area rug is now a shade lighter than before.  I would consider myself a very clean person, but I was living in filth and had no idea because I had ineffective tools.

We thought we had a perfectly fine vacuum (a self-propelled Hoover Windtunnel 2, about 8 years old), but it just wasn't doing the job. It would pick up a lot of the dog hair, but even if you ran over and over a spot, it never really got it clean. It's probably just as well to have the new color of carpet. If our old carpet held this much dog hair and we just didn't realize it, then it's better to know.Anyway, I did a lot of research online and narrowed my choices to this unit, the DC25 Animal, and the larger DC 28 Animal. I ultimately went with this one for the ball and the lighter weight, even though it sounds like the DC 28 is more powerful and would pull up more hair.This was a good choice. I vacuumed with the Hoover just before this arrived, then went over it again with the Dyson to see how it did on that remaining dog hair. It took it up with no problem. It cleans extremely well and it is really light and easy to use. I thought the ball thing might be something of a gimmick, but it really does make it much easier to handle. Two other things that make this stand out to me. The Hoover never would clean right against the walls. There was always a little half inch strip along the molding that I had to clean with the wand. This cleans right to the edge. Very nice. The other thing is that, even though the Hoover had a floor setting, it really didn't work on floors. It just blew dust around and didn't really pick it up. The Dyson does a really nice job on the hardwood floor.I'm not wild about the whole awkward extending handle thing, but it will do, and I otherwise really like the unit."

The prices in store were much higher than on Amazon, and with free shipping and delivery to my door within 5 days of ordering, I am a pleased Amazon customer!My previous vaccumm was a Kirby G2000....great vaccumm for getting up all the dust etc., but not so great for vaccumming all of the corners, furniture or anywhere you need a wand, since you have to take off the front of the vaccumm and put on the hose. I was also tired of spending money on bags that I could only buy at the Kirby store.The DC25 Animal is easy to maneuver, (although a bit 'heavy' to push sometimes) has great suction, on board hose and attachments, a great furniture cleaning tool, and no bags.I am grateful for the filtration which prevents that 'doggy' smell.Also like the fact that it automatically adjusts for carpet height and has a button to turn off the rotator/beater bar.The only things I have found so far that I don't like: the cord could be about 3ft longer, there could be a place for on board storage of the furniture tool, and the canister could maybe hold more.  These are all things which are not a big deal, though.The on board hose is a little tricky to get used to and I tend to pinch my fingers sometimes when I am in a hurry.  The furniture brush has to be held at the right angle to work well, but that is no big deal.I no longer dread vaccumming with this vaccumm!

To my great surprise, however, after vaccuming one time I found that it had pulled yarns out of a hand made rug in my dining room, leaving exposed areas that are very visible!  I have since discovered that Dyson knows about this issue and yet they don't have a specific warning in their manual. If you look through all the fine print, you will find a general statement about consulting with a flooring manufacturer before using it; however, you can't do that with rugs than are hand made or antique. I now have a damaged rug that was much more costly than the vacuum.  When I called Dyson, I was essentially told that the finer the rug, the greater the chance of damage due to the hand knotting. Wouldn't it make sense to place a clear warning in the manual? They suggested that I try turning off the brush bar when using it, but I found that it lost its ability to clean.  It is basically useless without the brush bar and there is no way to adjust its height.  If you have fine rugs, stay away from this product!"

However, we were in the market for a new home vacuum, and were going to turn the DC07 over as our small business's showroom vacuum cleaner.  We had seen the commercials for the Shark, wherein they claim it to be as good as Dyson for 1/3 the price.  So, we headed to Bed Bath & Beyond to check them out; because I'm not one to usually have brand loyalty and am all about inexpensive!Upon taking the Shark display down and giving it the once over, I could tell immediately that the quality is not nearly the same.  I was disheartened because of the price difference, but I decided to stick with Dyson and am so glad I did.  You get what you pay for in this case.The DC25 Animal has awesome suction (as I am used to).  Improved features that I noticed are the ease of use for the hose and attachments.  The maneuverability is awesome! It gets completely and easily under my end tables with no problem, and around my table legs with such ease.  It transitions from hardwood to rugs like a champ and doesn't suck up the smaller rug edges.  It is smaller than the old model, and doesn't require as much storage room - which I love!Our family consists of three kids and four dogs (one of which is a 170 lb. shedding machine), and I am a bit of a neat freak when it comes to the cleanliness of my floors.  I am one of those every day to several times a day vacumming kind of people, and I love my Dysons!!

Although this vacuum cleaner was reasonably effective to begin with and it was light and moved around easily, it very soon started to clog and lose it's suction power.  Dyson claim that this doesnt happen with their cleaners but I am afraid that it just isn't true, it has been a nigtmare, really appalling. I have found this to be the very worst feature. The filters clog up really quickly as well. It frequently got blocked and was very difficult to clean out.The dog hairs wound themselves around the brush head and clogged it up and stopped the brush from spinning. I had to literally take the end apart and cut the trapped hair balls with scissors to get them out. The brush on the end gradually wore loose and made a deafening noise. When it was replaced with a brand new part it it didnt work at all. didnt spin around and didnt pick up. The cleaner got noisier and noisier with a high pitched whine and it didnt pick up despite all airways seemingly clear.Have spent hours unblocking it and even then never satisfied with the quality of the cleaning. It got to the point where it wouldnt pick anything up at all. It has a ridiculously short lead as well and an awkward shape on the hose, useless for cleaning out cars. One of my friends also had the same experience with hers. One of the worst vacuum cleaner experiences ever,I got totally fed up and bought a George this week, which cleans brilliantly and washes the carpets as well. I am sorry but Dysons DO clog and DO lose suction."
"715","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","October 24, 2012","AF7FEXUCKR5BP","Dyson DC25","I don't generally write reviews but I found that some of the reviews misled me in one way or another. Hopefully, this will help those considering buying this type of vacuum.Empty Canister as Suggested:As most have stated, this vacuum has a lot of suction (more than any other vacuum that I've ever used) and the suction doesn't drop off as the vacuum fills. It is important, however, that you not allow the canister to fill beyond the max line because it begins to draw much more material up into the filter. When the filter (pre-motor filter, filter A) gets clogged, it will lose suction and it will make the motor overheat.Although I vacuumed regularly, the previous vacuum was clearly not doing a very good job. It was only removing the material from the top surface of the carpet. There was a section of carpet near an entry door that looked clean but when I used this vacuum on it initially, the entire roller housing turned brown. It was like I was vacuuming pure sand/silt. I didn't realize it but this was not good for this vacuum. In less than 5 minutes, the canister was filled to the max line. After filling the canister to the max line several times, the vacuum began to lose suction. At the time, I thought that there may be a serious problem with the vacuum. It was only recommended that the filters be cleaned after about 3 months. I didn't think that they could possibly have needed cleaning in less than 1 hour but they were both dirty. After removing the pre-motor filter, I could see that it was very dirty. Any slight movement of the filter would result in a huge dust cloud. I checked the second filter and it was so hot that I couldn't remove it from the vacuum until it cooled a bit. It was also very dirty. After cleaning the filters, the vacuum again worked as it should.Fine Silt:The type of dirt that was being drawn out of the carpet was a very fine silt (about as fine as baking flour). If you see that the majority of the material that you're vacuuming up is that fine, you should clean your filters much more frequently than is suggested by Dyson. If the quantity is such that the canister fills within a very short period of time, you should check the filters after a couple of hours of use.Using the Hose:In one review, someone complained that they had to use the 3ft wand and they couldn't understand why Dyson designed it that way. The wand clips on like any other accessory. If you don't want to use the wand, remove it and install the accessory tool directly onto the hose.There was a complaint that the hose was hard to extend. The hose is actually very flexible and easy to stretch out. This hose is designed to collapse. This is the only practical way to store 10+ feet of hose on-board. When the vacuum is on and you restrict the airflow into the vacuum, the hose will tend to contract. This is to be expected. If the vacuum had less suction, it would tend to contract less but that would defeat the purpose. I find it easier to have the vacuum behind me with the hose over my shoulder when using the hose. This makes it much easier to use the hose-end attachments for extended periods of time.Proper Orientation of the Vacuum:When using the hose with attachments, have the front of the vacuum facing away from you. This will ensure that the vacuum will move easily with you as you pull on the hose. If you pull on it from the side, it can pull the vacuum over. If you pull on it as suggested, it will follow you perfectly.Misleading Reviews:There are reviews that indicate that the vacuum doesn't have much suction because it can't pull a paper towel roll away from another vacuum. If a vacuum is properly designed/adjusted for the carpet, there will be very little leakage around the perimeter of the vacuum head. You want the air to be flowing up through the carpet, not from around the perimeter of the roller head. This vacuum does a very good job of sealing to the carpet which means that it pulls hard from deep in the carpet, not just from the surface.There is a review that shows the head flopping around as the reviewer flicks the vacuum from side to side. First, no one uses a vacuum like that unless they're intentionally trying to make it malfunction. Second, when the vacuum is running, the suction will keep the roller head pulled down to the carpet.Bag vs Bagless:Many people like bagless vacuums because they don't need to buy bags. For me, this vacuum has been a lot more work than a bag vacuum, especially since I had more crud under the carpet than most people due to using a poor performing vacuum previously. When considering buying a bagless vacuum, I think you need to see what sort of material that you are picking up. For larger material (lint, hair, bits of grass...), a bagless vacuum may be a good choice. If you have a lot of fine dirt/silt like I did, a bagged vacuum may be a better option. When I have to empty the canister, I have to do so outdoors. The dust is so fine that there is no way to prevent having a dust cloud. Even if I could empty it into an inside trash can without causing a dust cloud, it would be impossible to close the trash bag without making a mess. I have to go empty the canister outdoors.For those who say that they have the same problem (making a dust cloud) when changing the bags in their bag type vacuums, try this... When you open the vacuum and pull the bag off of the internal nozzle that goes into the bag, immediately cover the hole in the bag with a couple of strips of packing or duct tape. With the hole covered, you can handle the bag and no dust will escape.Poor Suction:There have been complaints that the DC25 has little or no suction. If you encounter that problem (especially with a new vacuum), you should look for leaks where the canister meets the body of the vacuum or on the various sections of hose. These vacuums have a lot of suction. It would be a shame to get rid of such a good vacuum for such a simple problem. As was mentioned before, the filters must be cleaned. It's also possible to suck something large up into the vacuum to make it lose suction.Thorough Cleaning:When cleaning the canister, you generally just push the release and let the contents fall out. If you have used it to clean really dirty carpets, you may want to go a step further. You should realize that the clear canister can be removed from the rest of the cyclone assembly. With that removed, you can easily remove any material stuck to the side of the perforated area. Any material there will reduce the airflow into the vacuum and reduce suction. When the filters need to be cleaned, I take the cyclone assembly apart and wash the entire assembly thoroughly. If it's really dusty, it's best to slowly submerge it in a bucket of soapy water. Submerging it quickly will cause a dust cloud. After the clinging dust/dirt is saturated, you can wash it out with a garden hose. There is only one part that may be affected by water and it's a small beige plastic assembly under the top cover. I either remove the top cover from the cyclone assembly or avoid getting that part wet. If you clean the cyclone assembly like this, be sure to let it dry completely before using it again. You can shake most of the water out of it. Shake it. Wipe it dry and then shake it again. Dry any remaining water with a cloth and let it dry. This applies to the canister/cyclone assembly only. Do not allow any other part of the vacuum to get wet.Pre-Motor Filter:When cleaning the pre-motor filter, I've found that it's easiest to do in a sink filled with water. I apply a soap (liquid hand soap or similar) and squeeze it repeatedly under water. The water will become very dirty if the filter is really dirty. Drain the water and continue to do this until the water remains clear. Wring the filter out and let it dry. You need to get out as much water as possible at this point to reduce drying time. You need to make sure that the filter is completely dry before using it again. The air passes thorough this filter and directly into the motor. If there is water in the filter, it will be pulled into the motor and is likely to damage the vacuum. This will not likely be covered under warranty.Motor Exhaust Filter:When checking the motor filter (the one in the ball), tap it on a hard surface. If dust is seen, it's time to clean it, even if it hasn't been 6 months. As was stated previously, dirty filters make the motor run hot and will likely reduce the life of the vacuum.Good Filtration:One thing that I've noticed with this vacuum is that there is no smell of dust in the air when using it, no matter the type of material being vacuumed (I've never tried vacuuming cigarette ashes and would avoid doing so). My other vacuums all emitted a smell of dust. There is absolutely no odor of any type when using this vacuum. A carbon filter is available that can reduce odor emission if that becomes a problem.Mini Turbine Head:For the 'animal' vacuums that have the rotating brush attachment (mini turbine head), there have been complaints that there is no suction because too much suction is used to turn the brush (air flow powers the roller, not electricity). If you have this problem, there is an issue with either the attachment or the vacuum. When both are working properly, the brush has plenty of power and there is plenty of suction. I did find that the bushing on the end of the roller needed a bit of lubrication to operate smoothly. They could solve this by using a ball/roller bearing instead of a brass sleeve bearing/bushing. If you have fine furniture, you would not want to lubricate the bushing. It works as it should but not as smoothly as it could with a proper bearing.Roller Drive Belt:When I initially began looking at vacuums, the first thing I did was to look at the belts that they used to drive the roller/beater bar. The problem that I had with my previous vacuum was that as soon as I got the vacuum adjusted to pick up properly, the roller would put too much stress on the belt and the belt would overheat. This would cause it to stretch and the roller would not longer spin as it should (you could hear it slow significantly on various parts of the carpet). This vacuum uses a cogged belt that cannot slip. It also has a secondary motor to drive the roller. This means that it takes no power from the motor creating the vacuum. If you inadvertently vacuum something that you shouldn't (like a long shoestring under a bed) and the roller is stopped, the power to the roller will be shut down (to protect the motor). When this happens, you can pull the shoestring (or whatever) from the roller. The roller motor will not restart on its own and won't restart if you push the roller button/switch. You have to turn the vacuum off and then back on to reset the roller motor.Proper Tool for the Job:There have been complaints that the vacuum wouldn't pick up large items like cereal and that a cheaper type of vacuum worked better. There is no device that will work well for every application. For a vacuum to pull up as much as possible from carpets, it needs to seal tightly to the carpet. This won't generally work well on large, solid objects. For those who need to pick up items like cereal, you may want to invest in a motorized sweeper. These have no vacuum. They only spin a brush to sweep material into a dustcup. Use the right tool for the job.Turning Sharply:Some people claim that it doesn't turn as sharply as advertised. It turns very well but not at a sharp 90, especially if you're not pushing it forward. It's still more maneuverable than any other upright vacuum that I've used.Cord Length:There have been complaints about the short cord. I don't find it too short. Longer means more cord to manage and to keep out of the way when vacuuming.Animal Version:For those who do not know, the animal version only varies from the all-floors model by the color (purple vs yellow) and the mini turbine tool (included with the animal model only - but available separately).No Light:There have been complaints about having no light. That is somewhat of a problem but is easily solved. I purchased a headlamp (Fenix HP11) and it works beautifully. It's also very useful when cleaning in dark areas without the vacuum. Having the light come from a higher position works better than any light that could be mounted on the vacuum. It's also very good in that it allows you to see in dark corners. It's amazing how much dirt/dust you can see when there is plenty of light. If you use this option, you'll want to invest in rechargeable batteries. If you're like me and already have plenty of rechargeable AA batteries, you won't have to invest in batteries and a charger. You can buy cheaper headlamps than the one suggested but the Fenix is very good and can be used for other things.Initial Assembly:Some have complained that it was difficult to assemble. There are only a couple of pieces but if you're not familiar with the design, I can see how it might be confusing. When you get it, the wand will not be attached. The hose plugs into the handle end of the wand. The wand goes onto the vacuum with the handle end down and the hose to the back of the vacuum. It may not be immediately obvious but the handle slides over the rounded post on the top of the body of the vacuum. When the handle is in place on the vacuum, the wand will slide down smoothly and easily into the hose. When it's all of the way down, there will be a click and the cover will close over the top of the wand. To remove the wand/handle, lift up on the red part of the wand until it detaches from the body of the vacuum. It's very simple after you see it done once but not immediately obvious if you've never seen a vacuum like this.Tool Storage:Some complain that there is no place to store all of the attachments on the vacuum. I purchased a tool bag to store the attachments. I purchased a second canister assembly so I use a tool bag that's large enough to hold that as well.Canister Capacity:There have been complaints about the canister capacity and having to empty it too often. This is to be expected for any type of bagless. No vacuum is perfect. If a vacuum is very powerful, you will have to empty it or replace the bags more often. Bagless vacuums always have less capacity than bagged vacuums of the same style/size. For people with pets that shed a lot, the canister will fill to the max line quickly because the hair won't settle to the bottom. If you have no pets, it will take much longer to fill the canister, especially after the initial use remove most of the deep-down dirt. A bagless with a larger canister will take a bit longer to fill but will still require frequent emptying."

It is noisy.  The hose is short and stiff making it a nuisance to use when cleaning window cills, etc.I have thought about replacing it many times for a lighter vacuum with more suction, one that I did see in a local vacuum shop and was less expensive.This is a heavily advertised vacuum, and expensive.

I looked no further than my housekeeper who was on her second Dyson, this one an Animal.  Our daughter calls it the pet vacuum and with good reason.  She has 2 dogs, we have a cat and not just any dog, but a full-coated rough collie who comes from a line of show dogs renown for their coats.Boy, does this vacuum work!  It's light, easy to maneuver and I just love the way you can switch to the hand-held nozzle for furniture.  Between the cat and the dog, I have to vacuum my furniture as much as much as I do the carpets and floor.  And speaking of floors, this vacuum has a button you push to turn off/on the beater bar so it goes from carpet to floor in a heartbeat.The only flaw I can see with this vacuum is that chord.  It's a one-room chord, whereas my previous vacuum was a 2-room chord.  A little aggravating to get used to but considering all the features the animal has in comparison to my other vacuums, and I'm pretty happy.  When I was shopping for my previous vacuum, I was told that the average life of a vacuum was 2 years.  Of course I stretched that out to 8 years because apparently I don't vacuum as often as other people, in fact, I might be a borderline hoarder, but enough about me, the Animal is a great vacuum, light weight, lots of suction and you can see in the canister how much dirt and hair you're picking up.  In fact the first time I went to empty the canister, without reading the instructions of course, I opened it up all over the floor in front of me.  I couldn't believe all the dirt.  Well, easy enough, I put the now-empty canister back on and vacuumed up the dirt for a second time.So, all in all, I'm very happy with my new vacuum and I paid only $100 more for it than I did for my Royal 8 years ago.  Now, while I can't say vacuuming is a joy, at least it's a bit more pleasurable.  Thanks, Mr. Dyson for your great product."

But, when black Friday came by and Home Depot had it for $385.00 I could not resist. Im glad I did not. I have a 4300 Sq.Ft. house and about 3500 of it is carpet. It used to take me hours to vacuum the floor because my Dirt Devil did not do a good job. I would avoid vacuuming like the plague. but now that I bought the Dyson Animal, I'm done in half the time. Believe it or not I don't mind the chore anymore. And I'm a guy! I think of this machine as a powertool for women. This machine Rocks!!I could not believe how much dirt was in my carpet. Actually, if you don't by a Dyson know that you're carpets are full of dirt and you're living in it. This machine is so easy to use and the ball feature makes it very easy to manuver. I also like how everything fits together and it is very lightweight. I can't wait until they come out with a carpet cleaner."

This has never happened with the Dyson  - it gets everything and we only have to use the hand attachments for things that actually need it, like our furniture.I would recommend the Dyson to any household, but especially those with pets that shed."

I groom them indoors, and then vacuum after the three-times weekly combings. I had a clunky Kirby for years, and it finally gave out. Asking around in my circle of pet-owner friends, everyone said, 'Get a Dyson Animal!' I was a bit put off by the price, but this has been the best investment in a household appliance I have ever made. When I first bought it, I vacuumed with the Kirby first. Then I went over the same territory with the Dyson Animal DC25. I couldn't believe how much more it picked up, from dog hairs to dust!I am a huge fan of this machine for carpets. And the suction is great for other applications, too. But I am a bit disappointed in limited attachments provided for the price. I've had to purchase the extra attachment set, which added to the price of the vacuum.Also, cleaning the filters is a bit of a pain four times a year. I suspect most people don't clean the filters, since it involves dismantling the machine.Still, this machine is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a pet."

The first a small DC24 (all floor; light weight) has done a WONDERFUL job over the 4 years I've owned it.  I have 2 persian cats and wanted the animal to help with cat hair on the posts and also being larger than the DC 24 I have, this house is much larger, something that can handle all my needs. I kept the DC24 for light jobs when we have a 2nd story house, etc. (we are military so we move a lot). At this time the DC25 sucked up a full load of what the Hoover I bought just under 60days ago did not ( I took back the hoover). I was trying to be cheap and although I knew that the Dyson was better, I thought that the price savings would make up for any inferior vacuum the hoover would be. Well it did not make up for anything! The hoover is AWFUL and I took it back! Amazon has the BEST price on this vacuum which retails for $550+.. I paid $438 no tax, no shipping.I could NOT be more pleased. There is NO comparison to the dyson. I know it's a lot to spend for a vacuum but it's worth every penny. Sucked up years of cat hair off the post.  The hoover belt already smoked, bottom plate popped off ( I had the hoover windtunnel pet for under 60 days). I missed the ball too with the hoover. My DC 24 has a ball and  so does the DC25 Animal. With the ball, you can literally vacuum with ONE hand and the flick of your wrist!!!! SOOO easy it's  Amazing.  If you've never used a dyson w/ the ball, you are in for a MUCH  better experience to vacuum! Flick your wrist it moves, push it and it's comparable to a self propelled lawn mower to a non self propelled mower (all non ball vacuums; non dysons)! It moves SO easily! It sucks VERY well, yet does not mess up the new carpet in our  house! The hoover tears up the carpet, and I have several clear plastic strings coming up from the hoover being too rough. Yet, the dyson gets more dust, dander, and lint/hair than the hoover did, it's much easier on the carpet. Glides along vs tugging.  The chord is long enough. Overall,  quality is just 'it' .. you do get what you pay for.. shop around, amazon.com will always have the best price. Even if you do not have a pet the 'animal' has features that might be useful to you vs the all floors: it includes a MUCH better accessory with it's own brush roll, attachments, and what I feel is a better overall vacuumI noticed another positive for dyson: both this DC25 and my DC24: nothing can touch the bare floor quality, it goes from my rugs on the kitchen floor to the vinyl to ceramic with EASE. The hoover I had to lift up and manipulate to get it over a rug, the dysons: NO problem! EASY to get from a rug, to bare to carpet...  A neighbor borrowed my DC24 and she was AMAZED at the bare floor suction... dyson's are also lower and I can get RIGHT up to my baseboards under kitchen cabinets, no rubbing, etc... My son gets asthma like symptoms and technically could be diagnosed with asthma; 'allergy induced bronchitis' that sometimes requires nebs and inhalers as well during the spring.  This vacuum is accepted by the allergy and asthma institute certified. He's not allergic to cats, however, this vacuum does  cuts down on hair and allergy airborne particles that bother him.

My husband and I lead a very active life between our Boxer puppy and housecat the pet hair was getting over the top!  It seems like every year I am always standing in the vacuum aisle blowing another [...] on a new vacuum that claims it has new technology blah blah blah.  Sure, they are bagless but they also suck (no pun intended) at picking up even obvious pet hair to the naked eye while just recirculated all the dust and grime to stir up my allergies.  [...]  After bringing the box inside, the vacuum snapped together in an easy 5 minutes and the instructions in the box were clear and simple to follow.  I did an experiment before I tried out the Dyson: I vacuumed my living room with my 1 year old Bissel and then back over the same room with the Dyson.  The Dyson picked up THREE canisters of pet hair and dust. WOW WOW WOW!  I used the attachment to pick up the cat hair my cat has left on the couch and it was unbelievable.  The carpet feels so much cleaner in between my toes and it's a great feeling!  The previous reviews state that the canister is too small--it is a little bit on the small side but if that means I have to empty it a few more times--big deal!  The cord does not seems short at all--unless you have only one outlet in your house, its really not noticeable.  For how easy this is to get the vacuum up & going and for how great of a job it does, any of those 2 shortcomings seem like nothing.  Well worth every penny and no more buying crappy vacuums because this one comes with a 5 year warranty!  At the rate I purchase vacuums it will pay for itself in 3.5 years. Bravo!!"

But after many lost battles agains the animal (and husband) hair in my house I became interested. I started researching and also saw a consumer report on my local news. I was so determined to get one that I asked my husband for one for my birthday (true determination). To my suprise he got me one... Man does it SUCK! Love it!!!I decided to 'test' it myself. I currently have an old (15 years?) top of the line vacuum. After running the old vacuum I ran the Dyson animal ball to see if it would collect more hair like it did on the news. It did!Score: Dyson 1  Old one: 0I put powder on the floor (actually my son spilled my good bath powder on the floor).Score: Dyson 2  Old one: .5The cat food Gavin spilledScore: Dyson 4  Old one: 1 (I know you are thinking 2 points?! there is enough suction that the brushed don't shoot the food out of the back of the vacuum, so it only took like 2 sweeps to get it all)the big test...I turned the brushes off to take it across the hard wood floor to another room as to not scratch the floor and to my suprise it started to pull hair from around the floor into the vacuum and I wasn't really trying to vacuum that floor just get across it.To anyone like me that has animals and lots of hardwood you know that no vacuum has ever been able to clean the pet hair up from the upright position (ie. not using the wand).

Since we have two dogs (a Labradoodle and a Lab), and it bills itself as a vaccuum for people that have animals, we thought we would give it a try.From the moment we unpacked it, we realized that it is cheaply put together, and just feels cheap.  Lose one star for that.The instructions were pretty minimal, which created a little bit of grief as we tried to put it together.  Where does this plug in?  How does it plug in? etc.  Lose another star for that!After assembling it (without breaking anythying), we decided to clean our carpets.  I guess I would say that it did an okay job, but I had to run over several spots multiple times (though they only require one swipe with the Electrolux).  The pickup canister was admittedly interesting - kinda neat to see what gets picked up.  The canister certainly filled up the 'max' line quickly, and required emptying several times (gee, the bag in the Electrolux, seems to last a couple/few months)...On to the stairs and WHOA!  The brush for the stairs is NOT POWERED at all, relying instead on the suction power of the unit to run the brush.  Needless to say, that did not go well at all.  Lots of frustrated trading off with my husband as we struggled to clean the stairs with this unit.  We called the 800 number on the vaccuum, and the Dyson folks told us that it must be our carpet - odd, that the Electrolux doesn't have any issue with it!  Another star lost.If it can't do the stairs, we figure, then what is the use?  We just finished packing it up and returning.  Long story short, I do NOT recommend this for someone that has pets that shed and carpetted stairs.Sorry!"

It has serious engineering flaws","I bought this vacuum because, coming from a science and engineering background, I appreciate a well engineered product and I had heard good things about the engineering design of this vacuum.  But the Dyson has disappointed me in several key respects in that area; so much so, that this vacuum cleaner *seriously* annoys me every time I use it, even though it ultimately gets the job done in the end.The pros:1) It does have pretty good suction, compared to our old bagless upright.  I have no complaints about how well it cleans our carpets and hardwood floors, although I have noticed that it does not pick stuff up as well on hardwood as it does on carpet.  It still does better on hardwood than our old vacuum, however.2) It is fairly easy to maneuver.3) It is fairly lightweight and easy to carry. It is also compact and easy to store.4) You don't have to read a big thick manual to get started with it.  You take it out of the box, and little easy-to-follow pictograms show you how to snap it together and get it started.5) I can wash the canister out, which I like to do on a regular basis to reduce allergens, and get rid of that 'dirty dog' smell that vacuums develop if you don't do this.The cons:1) As noted by other reviewers, dirt mixed with dog hair does not willingly come out of the canister unless you stick your hand in there to pull it out. Yuck.2) I *hate* the hose/wand attachment.  It is the absolute most annoying thing about this vacuum.  The wand telescopes into the hose, and about 25% of the time I have great difficulty sliding the wand out.  I am worried I am going to break the plastic one of these days because I have to pull so hard.  I have no idea why sometimes it comes out relatively easily, and other times I am pulling and straining and swearing a blue streak trying to get the d*mn thing out.3) More on why I *hate* the hose/wand: the thought that went into engineering the ergonomics of this attachment is non-existent!  I always vacuum the periphery of my rooms first with the hose/wand, and I find that I am trying to maneuver a long rigid wand on the end of a quite short flexible hose.  I always have to kink the hose over to get the wand to touch the floor, which I am sure is going to drastically shorten the lifetime of the hose.  It also decreases the suction, and stuff tends to clog up where the kink is.  This vacuum is simply not designed for use of the hose/wand on any surface less than 6 feet up.  And forget about anything more than about 7.5 feet up, because the wand isn't long enough unless you physically lift the vacuum cleaner higher.4) The power button for the motor head does not properly start the motor head until you push it 3, 4, 5+ times.  You hit it, and the motor head starts, but as soon as you release the button, the motor head stops.  So you push, push and push again until the d*mn thing finally engages.  I expect a lot higher quality than this from a high priced vacuum.Every time I use this vacuum I am ultimately satisfied with the job it does, but I get very, *very* annoyed in the process.*********************Update: Jan 31, 2012I now give this vacuum cleaner 1 star (and would give it 0 stars if I could).  The starter switch on the vacuum cleaner has completely broken and it cannot be turned on.  It is unacceptable that I now have to shell out what is likely to be at least $100 for repairs to a $500 supposedly-top-of-the-line vacuum cleaner that is less than 18 months old.  I'm never buying another Dyson product again."

When I do marry my iphone, I'm going to cheat on it with my Dyson! I love it just as much as my iphone!I have been vacuuming for the last two hours with my new Animal. First, I had no idea my house was so dirty. Suction is fabulous! Picks up my 85 lb Lab's hair like a dream. Also, I live in Florida by the beach so sand is continuously being tracked into my house. I was shocked at how much sand was in the canister. I had no idea. Second, The ease of transferring between different floor types is a breeze. Third, transitioning to using the wand is also a snap. Fourth, emptying the canister is as easy as it gets...no touching the icky stuff. Fifth, the ball is a dream, I didn't realize how heavy my old vacuum was or how hard of a chore vacuuming was with my old vac until I used my Dyson. Sixth, This vacuum is easy to carry upstairs, When I tried lifting the other Dyson Animal (non-ball) it was too heavy. The ball is very manageable.The only gripe I have is the use of the wand. While vacuuming the stairs it is difficult to achieve the right angle on the hose attachment because the wand itself is a solid rigid piece and seems too long to me. It's almost like you have to back away from whatever you are vacuuming to vacuum it comfortably.  And when I pull on the wand/hose to move further up the stairs, I seem to pull the vacuum itself closer to me on the tile floor (needs a brake!). I wish the wand itself was more flexible and that would make it easier to achieve the right angle for suction.I read all the reviews before I purchased. Some people mention the size of the canister...I don't see this as a problem with regular vacuuming. The first time I vacuumed with it, I emptied the canister 9 times for a 2200 square foot home. I guess that is a testament to how much more this vacuum picks up with it's awesome suction! My old vac obviously couldn't keep up!The other complaint from other reviewers was the cord length. Personally I think that if the cord was any longer it would be a burden to keep off the floor and out of the way of the vacuum while I was vacuuming. With that said my house is an open floor plan with a combined living, dining, kitchen and den with no walls...so it's very easy to move between rooms.All in all, if I had to spend the money all over again...I would buy this vacuum again, and again or at least until Dyson comes out with the next new improved version and then I'll buy that. It's not perfect but it's as good as it gets."

There are lots of glowing reviews here, so let me inject some criticisms for those interested in purchasing this vacuum.-The ball is an improvement but not as great as advertised. It probably enhances mobility by about 10%, while adding strain to your wrist. Overall, I'd say it is an improvement over regular wheels, but just barely.-The hose collapses compactly, making a streamlined looking vacuum, but the tension on it is too strong when stretched. This makes using it to clean stairs impractical. I found holding the entire vacuum with two hands to do stairs was simpler, faster, and with less strain. Also, the promotional image of the woman stretching out the hose is false advertisement. If you barely stretch it (about 20% elongation), the vacuum will come rolling towards you.-Aside from the purple color and turbine brush, there is no difference between the Animal and the All Floors model. This also means there is no place on the vacuum to attach the turbine brush. If it's not on the vacuum, you're much less inclined to utilize it.-Emptying the canister is more than just touching a button and releasing the dust. Dust also collects around the perforated grill area. On every empty, I find myself having to press a second release, remove the upper portion of the canister, and brush away the stuck on dust. Overall, still easier than with the Eureka.-Picked up less dust than I expected. This may be due to the brush bar, with sparse bristles, which doesn't dig down enough into my medium-pile carpet.And some good notes:-The exhaust for this vacuum is very clean--the HEPA filter is no gimmick. I often smelled hints of dust from the Hoover and Eureka, assuming that's just how vacuuming smells. This is totally different.-The brush bar gets less hair tangled in it than with my previous vacuums. Whether this is due to it not picking up the hair, or the hair entering the canister is hard to determine. I've been using a Roomba, so it may be keeping hair levels down.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase, but only at the extreme discount I got. I would not but this vacuum at the retail price."

(and we have a pretty small house) I can't believe how much dust and junk it picked up that my old vacuum missed.  It works great and seems to be very well made.

For those who have never bought a Dyson.... stop reading and buy the DC25!  Ok, for the rest of us....  I would like to compare the DC25 Animal to the DC07 (one of Dyson's earliest models).  Our DC07 broke down... RIP old friend.Good points on DC07:- Cord length is awesome.  I can vacuum the entire living room/dining area without changing outlets.- Bucket size is bigger than the DC25 and is easier to empty.  It is also easier to put back into the cleaner.- Bigger motor.  (Although the DC25 is supposed to be more efficient.)- Quieter.  This is because the DC25 has 2 motors (one for the main motor, and a separate one for the floor bristles).  Turn the bristles off on the DC25 and they are about the same.Good points on DC25:- Much more efficient.  I steam cleaned the carpet last week, then used the DC25.... OMG there was a ton of dog hair!  I didn't even see it on the floor!- Narrower.  This is a benefit because you can go between chair legs (I couldn't before).- The ball.  Need I say more?  The ball is awesome.  You can turn on a dime.  The form factor also allows you to go further under couches.- The Animal has a cool vacuum attachment for the arm extention.  Although they didn't include a spot to put it on the cleaner. :(- Two additional filters that can be hand cleaned.- You can turn off the bristles on the floor suction.  There is a separate button.- Lighter.Bad points to DC25:- The arm extention is clumsy.  The DC07 wasn't great either, but the extention on the DC25 appears heavier and is much shorter in comparison.- Cord length is too short.- The bucket seems cheaply made and doesn't easily snap in when you put it back into the vacuum.- The cool vacuum attachment doesn't have a place in the cleaner."

I bought this pet version of the Dyson (Dyson DC25 Animal) because I figured it would also be great to use to clean up after my three cats.  Big Mistake!!  It turns out that fine powder or dust, such that you'd get from cats using a litter box with clay litter, can clog the Dyson.  You're out of luck if you spill flour on the floor as well.  The customer service rep. told me that they don't recommend using the Dyson around the litter box.  She also informed me that I'd have to send the Dyson in for service and that the repair of cleaning the inside of the vacuum would NOT be covered under the warranty!!  So now I have a completely useless $500 vacuum!!  This vacuum is marketed specifically as an animal vacuum, but you can't use it to clean up after cats.  That is absolutely rediculous!!

Overall happy with it after one month.","Vacuum reviews are not very meaningful unless the reviewer has had some time to use it for awhile, rather than reviewing on the same day they use it for the first time. I have used my new DC25 Animal for a month now, hopefully I will be as happy with it in 5 years after the warranty expires as I am now. The good outweigh the bad for me (so far).  Ultimately, a great vacuum is all about great suction, and this vacuum has it and does not lose it.The Good:-Suction. It passes my suction test. With the hose it can easily lift and hold a size 11 men's tennis shoe off the floor. It can also nearly suck the curtains completely off from the curtain rods if you're not careful.-The ball. At first I thought this would be a gimmick.  But it really does make vacuuming easier. It practically steers itself in all the hard to reach areas.-5 year warranty.  Enough said.-Easy to remove canister.-Easy to wash filters.-Brush on/off switch (as long as vacuum is not locked upright - see the bad below).-Brush extremely effective.-Excellent carpet performance.-Excellent bare floor performance.-Feels relatively durable, despite being all plastic.-Online product registration easy.-Online support looks above average.  Although hopefully I won't actually have to use it.-Vacuuming is actually a bit more fun.The bad:-The price, even though Amazon had it for $100 less than everywhere else.-Short cord. All the other reviews are right. I didn't think it would bug me, but it does.-Canister a bit small.-Brush automatically shuts off when vacuum is locked upright. That is not ideal for vacuuming carpeted stairs.-The wand and hose can not be used unless you completely unwrap the cord from it.-The hose can not detach unless you have the wand lifted completely out.-Assembly and operating instructions are a bit confusing. No text, all vague pictures.-Mini turbine head is weak. The majority of suction is used to spin its brush, leaving less suction to pick up dirt. The DC25 Animal was actually cheaper than the regular DC25, so no loss here.-For the price, it really needs one of two more additional on-board attachments included besides the two little ones that are.-Animal hair clings inside canister, does not empty from canister so easily without shaking rigorously or using hand to pull it out.In short: I still love this vacuum despite all the improvements in could use."

I have 2 cats - one of which is a very messy eater. With my old $50 Dirt Devil, this was never a problem. However, my $500 Dyson apparently thinks this is a major problem. On hard surfaces, no matter with the brush on or off, the Dyson just rolls over the pieces of cat food, which then get stuck under the head. I have to either use one of the attachments, or go back over the cats eating area with my little hand held dust buster just to pick it all up!I took the unit in for repair under warranty and was told there is nothing wrong with it. Their answer to me was basically that I should switch cat food. Seriously?Aside from this, the vacuum really is ok. Not great, but ok. It is quite easy to maneuver around, and does most of the things I need it to do. Fortunately, my husband and I received this as a wedding gift, so at least we aren't out the money.

The Kirby was awesome but replacing the bags was getting way out of hand.  Much too expensive to keep the Kirby.  I read a lot of reviews on the Dyson on different websites and came across the Animal Dyson on Amazon.com which was a $140.00 cheaper than buying it locally.  Most of the reviews were excellent and a few really worried me.  I bought the Animal Dyson anyway and I am so glad I did!! Those few people that had problems must have bought lemons.  There are always a few lemons in everything you buy from cd players to cars.  Some people complained that it was too heavy.  Those people should try pushing a Kirby.  The Dyson is so light weight and actually fun to use.  It just glides over the carpet.  We have 3 different heights of carpet in our house and the Dyson works great on all of them.  Someone complained about the hose feeling cheap.  I just can not imagine what kind of sweeper that person had before.  My Kirby had the stiffest plastic hose I had ever seen.  The hose on the Dyson is very flexible and does not feel cheap to me.  Another person complained about the Dyson not picking up well and not sucking up debris along the baseboards.  I just don't understand these complaints because mine works fantastic! One person said the Dyson was hard to put together.  Trust me, you do not need to be a scientist to put this thing together.

It does allow for access to tighter areas, but I would rather use the attachments for that and get 2 to 4' more head width.2) there is no carpet hight adjustment, so you have to work harder on high cut pile where the suction makes movement harder3) there is no light, I miss the light4) the cord is short and for my bigger rooms I have to use multiple outlets5) one speed motor6) the mechanics in back to raise and lower this unit to the floor is plastic, flimsy and does not reflect superior engineering.

As a note I have a Hoover Windtunnel bought about 5 years ago. I bought the Dyson DC33 on Sat., took it home, put it together, and used it. I was kind of happy until I brought out my Hoover. Turned them both on to compare the suction - Hoover won, the DC33 went back.I bought the DC25 Animal and brought it home. I had read that the only difference between the All Floor DC25 and Animal were the accessories. I conducted a couple of different tests to determine if it was going back to never buy a Dyson again. I tested the suction - very good, then put it to work on a the cream colored carpet in the hallway that has had caked on dust along the baseborads for ages - WOW!, after vacuming over a few times, what a major difference, although the carpet still needs cleaned, no more dark dust along the baseboards and the carpet cleaning dude told me they were they to stay! Next test - cream colored carpet in a bedroom that is not used, but was cleaned and vacumed 2 weeks ago and then the door was closed. Now, I expected to pick up some stuff, but definitely not as much as I did. Again, DC25 Animal was so far in my good graces. Next test, wood floors with dust bunnies from a shedding Lab. I have used my Hoover to suck up all the stuff on the floor, but still always something left, whereby I would sweep and dust again. The Animal got along all the little crevices and I was happy that there was nothing left to suck up. I also used it on a Belgian Wool navy blue rug -what a difference. I also used it on a couple of older braided rugs, YEAH!! It worked in getting everything that sticks to those older type of rugs. I di dnotice the house has a cleaner smell to it after vacuming.I'll keep it! But, have to try the tool on the stairs - again cream colored carpet.Now, for those there are considering if its worth the price:1. I used a 30% Kohl's coupon2. I am an Engineer and had no issue putting it together, however, my husband couldn't figure some things out. The written instructions are minimal, so review the pictures.3. I have various types of carpet, but the one thing I noticed was that the beater bar didn't put lines or marks in your carpet so if you are used to walking in the room and noticing the carpet has been 'raked' you won't necessarily get it with this, but do know your carpet is clean. I'll use my Hoover for that so I get pretty lines in my in-laws bedroom.4. There is no storage compartment or clip for the smaller stair accessory.5. You must fill out the paperwork for the warranty.6. The length of the cord is fine for me, but may be short for others, it is still as long or longer than my Hoover.7. The design is easy once you get used to it works. It is not as clunky as my Hoover WT.8. When emptying the container, I still have to reach up and pull the dog hair out, but it is not as dirty as my Hoover. I have to use an air compressor on the Hover filter each time I use it. The Dyson I knock on the trash can a couple times and pull stuff out if necessary. The Dyson is still cleaner to clean than my Hoover.9. The exhaust air is actually clean and does not smell. When vacuming dog hair up with the Hoover, the exhaust air smells like animal hair, not so with the Animal. It is actually clean.10. Test it yourself and if you don't like it, take it back. The Animal picked up fuzz and dust I didn't know I had.I will keep both my Hoover and Dyson - I'll use the Hoover to pick up the dirtier messes - I have a Lab and a houseful of teen/20 something boys - and the Dyson afterwards to get what the Hoover does not."

Those vaccuums seemed to do OK at first, but I always had to buy the expensive cloth bags to keep the emissions down.  The fine clay dust would go right through those bags and filters and clog them up very quickly. I could only use a bag for one or two times then had to replace it, long before it was full because of the emissions.

The Dyson barely picked anything else up - I think it's because I keep my floors relatively clean to begin with, and perhaps I didn't give my old Dirt Devil enough credit.  I do believe that the Dyson has great suction and gets things clean.  It also has a VERY easy cannister to empty, and I like that there are no bags to buy and washable filters.  It is also very light-weight.  With that said, the following cons were deal breakers for me, and I ultimately returned it after trying and trying for a month to get used to using it:1.  My old Dirt Devil has swivel caster wheels in the front and back, and the Dyson ball was actually far less maneuverable than the Dirt Devil.  The ball makes it hard to steer in a straight line if you are trying to clean along the edge of a wall.  The vacuum tends to want to wabble all over the place due to the ball design.2.  The edge cleaning did not work well at all compared to my Dirt Devil, and I usually had to follow with an attachment to clean near the baseboards.3.  The hose connects to the bottom of the vacuum and sticks out on the side.  Additionally, the gray wheels that are used to roll the vacuum from one room to another when not in use also stick out on the sides.  This means that when steering around corners, furniture, etc., the hose and the wheels often bump into objects.  Apart from making it difficult to get around, the wheels are also made of hard plastic which can scratch or scuff your walls.4.  The part of the vacuum which cleans the floors has a hard plastic bumper instead of a rubber bumper.  The bumper is relatively flush with the vacuum, which means areas of the vacuum above the bumper make contact with the walls, too.  I noticed it taking some of the paint off the walls (scuffs on the vacuum that are the same color as my walls/baseboards).  Though I didn't see visible damage on the walls (yet), obviously if it is removing paint, it is causing damage, and over time I worried this would be an issue.5.  The #1 deal breaker for me is that the hose and attachments are a HUGE pain.  If you are at all concerned about the hose being too stiff, DO NOT purchase this product.  The hose is so stiff that it will tip the vacuum over or roll the vacuum towards you before it will stretch out, especially when using on tile or hard floors that do not have any extra resistance.  Additionally, the wand is about 3 feet long when attached and makes it hard to use the attachments for up close jobs like cleaning window sills or upholstery.  I found I would have to disconnect the wand and connect the attachments directly to the hose, which meant having no wand at all, but was easier than using the long one.  The wand is difficult to detach and made it a huge hassle to quickly take the wand out and clean an area as I saw it.  My dirt devil hose attached in a snap, and the wand was only about 1.5 feet long and I could attach an extension if needed, which proved more practical for my purposes.  I have heard that the hose may stretch after extended use, but it was so hard to use, that I do not believe I would have had the ability to use it enough to stretch it out.  My husband tried stretching the hose and leaving it overnight, but it didn't make a significant difference.It's a shame that there are so many design flaws, because I believe the vacuum itself is very powerful.  However, I constantly utilize the hose and attachments on my old vacuum, and to own a vacuum where this is so inconvenient that it deters me from using it, it's just not worth it.  I am on the hunt for a better replacement and will use my $50 Dirt Devil in the meantime."

We had heard the design vacuums were good products and had seen them in use at the houses of family and friends. We decided to get one for ourselves and we got it from amazon.com.When it arrived it was extremely easy to setup, took only about five minutes and required no tools. I vacuumed our house with our current vacuum (an orek upright) and only after the floor looked clean did I try out the dyson.One pass with the dyson and I was convinced. It picked up so much that the other vacuum missed, it dug down deep into the carpet and got all that pet hair, all the little lint that had fallen into the cracks, and the attachments cleaned our couches, behind the vents and throughout our kitchen.The thing turns on a dime, is very easy to use and navigate, and doesn't scratch up the furniture or the walls.Best vacuum ever!"

The bin is plenty big - handles most of the house without needing to be emptied.  I have 3 cats, 4 litter boxes, a toddler and an infant. This vacuum sucks up all the litter, fur, sandbox sand, more without kicking up any dust. It isn't too noisy.  I use it from the carpet right onto the tile- works on all floors with no adjustments. My carpet finally looks clean, and I don't curse anymore when it's time to vacuum.  My only complaints 1) the cord could be better - I like the ones that retract, also this one could be a little longer 2) the wand could have better instructions. It's cool, but it took me a bit to figure it out.  I have a hard time angling it for windows. Oh- the mini turbo doesn't have a storage spot on the vacuum.

The swirling deodorant scratched the heck out of the plastic container. Although still functional, the conainer is a mess.  The cyclones are clogged and I need a new one.  When I talked to customer service, they said this vaccuum should not be used with any cleaning product, even Resolve carpet cleaner.

I have 3 cats and they are still shedding well into summer. The ball feature is fabulous - really makes it simple to move the vacuum.I've read before about the fact that the canister fills up quickly, but it doesn't really seem like that big a deal to me.

The plastic is cheap and they are EXPENSIVE to repair. Also, I suggest looking into the health of using a bag-less vacuum. The whirlwind action grinds the dirt particles into a super fine powder. This powder clogs the motor and goes into the air that you and your family breathe. The whirling action also serves to fluff up the dirt, making it look like it picks up more than it actually does.The Dyson does have a lot of suction, but that is not the only feature to look for in a vacuum. Quality is extremely important. If you have pets or long hair you want a vacuum with a metal brush roll (beater bar), and enclosed end-caps. You also want fairly stiff bristles on the brush roll. A vacuum with ABS plastic will hold up longer than other types of plastic. But, please, for the health of you and your family...buy a vacuum with a bag!Don't buy a vacuum because you saw an advertisement on TV or because your friend has one. If you can find a nice vacuum store, go in and talk to the employees about a vacuum that fits YOUR current lifestyle. Ask to try them, compare the different features. A nice vacuum will make your home a healthier environment. This is especially important if you have any little ones crawling around. Also, if it is important to you, there are some very nice vacuums made in the United States."

Dyson got the suction part right. What they did not get right is the brush. A vacuum is much more than just suction. You can have great suction, but the vacuum is not going to pick up well without a good brush getting the dirt, hair, dust, etc. up from the carpet so the suction can take it away. Have you ever broken a belt on a vacuum cleaner? If so, you noticed it would not pick up anything because the brush was not spinning. It still had suction, but no brush getting the stuff up.I was vacuuming with the Dyson in a room with burgandy carpet. My dog is a Golden Lab. The dog's yellow hair shows up very well on the burgandy carpet. I found myself vacuuming a spot, only to see hair still on the carpet in that spot. I went over it several times with the vacuum, but the hair was still there. I was able to pick the hair up with my fingers. I then checked out the brush closely and realized that was the problem. The brush just does not do what it is supposed to do. First of all the brush does not have many bristles. Secondly, the brush part is allowed to move all over the place. This just does not work.I returned this vacuum and purchased a $160.00 Hoover Windtunnel Animal. It was advertised as, 'Never looses suction.' It is a much better vacuum than the Dyson. I used it to vacuum the room with burgandy carpet and it picked up everything the Dyson had left behind!"

The first time I used this in my 900 square foot condo I had to empty the bucket THREE times. That is how much hair this thing sucked up. It's actually a little horrifying how much hair was apparently on my carpets, but this sweeper works like a dream and my carpets look brand new again.

"791","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","August 2, 2010","A2NL32KXXB7VON","Objective, In-Depth Review","We purchased the DC25 Animal Ball about two weeks ago.  What I would've liked to have seen before purchasing is a review that gave me all the answers- but I quickly realized such a review doesn't exist.  It's impossible to tell the difference between what's always true and what's anecdotal, what's proven and what's someone's opinion, brand loyalists, people who are determined to be underwhelmed or unhappy with the product, etc.  So, in an effort to help everyone out there who is in the same position I was- here is my attempt at all the answers for you:Some background- we are a family of 3, with 2 Shiba Inu's that are adorable but shed year round, -especially- in the summer.  I don't mean there is a little hair here and there, I mean there is literally hair wafting through the air, it is EVERYWHERE, and it never lessens or ends despite hours of 'furminating'.  Beyond that, we are not overly zealous when it comes to cleaning and tend to value our time together over time spent vacuuming/dusting.  We also are not the kind of family that can throw around $400-$500 willy nilly.  So if we're going to spend it, it better be worth it.  That said, we had spent over $300 on vacuums over the last 3 years.  Some were nice (Hoover Windtunnel), some were Walmart brands, etc.  But all of them broke, -multiple- times, all of them clogged, and none of them were easy, or even began to help solve the hair problem.  Recently, the latest model went to vacuum heaven, so my husband and I began a very long, tiring search into all the available brands and models and which would be best for us.  Obviously, my biggest hesitation here was the money.  The reviews for Dyson are generally good, but what I wanted to know was, is it such a good product that it's worth a downpayment on a car?  Here's what I found, so you don't have to:If someone had told me, 'This is the best vacuum cleaner you can buy for $400', I would've said, 'eh...'  But if someone had told me, 'Yes the vacuum is expensive, but it will clean your entire house, every nook and cranny while still being easy to use, easy to lift, and fun', I might've saved myself some sleepless nights.Pro's:-The vacuum is -incredibly- easy to use. I have to laugh when I read reviews where people say it took them forever and a manual to make the vacuum work, or to use the attachments.  I don't mean to be confrontational, but if you can write a review (or even if you can't), you can successfully use this vacuum and all the attachments/abilities.  Everything on the vacuum uses the same 'button release', and it is simple to figure out.-The ball is fantastic.  When you have a smaller house with furnishings, it's important to be able to get around and under things without breaking your back.  Not to mention that the vacuum is less bulky, less rigid, and easier to move in general than any other vacuum I've seen to date.  This includes my mother's $1200 Kirby.-There is an attachment for everything, and it takes less than 5 seconds (I counted) to choose one, hook it up and start using it.  If you have hair all over your sofas, or your bedspread, behind your toilet, on top of your fan blades, or even just a healthy buildup of dust- there's an attachment for that, and it will blow your mind.-The hose is incredibly long and flexible, it can reach anywhere- plus you have the choice of using the rigid 3 feet of hose with the handle attached which is handy for floor trim where you don't want to bend over constantly, or of detaching the rigid part from the flexy hose so that you can get to small spaces that are hard to navigate.-The canister is slightly smaller than some vacuums I've used, but it actually holds MORE because it compacts everything very neatly and easily without you doing anything.  When you're going to empty the canister 2-3 times per vacuum or more, you don't want to mess with bags and you don't want to mess with a canister that is coated in dust and grimy after every emptying.  This canister empties and stays clean- again because of the compacting.-The suction on this thing is ridiculously wonderful.  It pulled over 3x more hair out of my carpet than even the Hoover Windtunnel, and it pulled out dust which I have never seen in my other vacuum's canisters/bags.  After vacuuming, my house literally -smelled- cleaner and fresher.  This is new to us, and we love it!  Additionally, I watched it pull hair from under our bed and furniture on hardwood from over 10 feet away.  Fantastic!!-The vacuum has a 5 year warranty- everything is covered, and Dyson is incredibly easy to work with.  That means that if it loses suction in 2015, I can get it replaced for free.  That means my total cost for the next 5 years is a maximum of $430.  Considering the vacuum is already far superior to all the others, it's already cheaper and more satisfying to own a Dyson than it is any other vacuum.-The vacuum is just generally fun to use.  My husband who hates cleaning was so excited he vacuumed the whole house just because it was fun!  It took half the time it usually does, and it was easy to carry downstairs, even for me being 4 months pregnant.Con's:-The only con I can think of for this vacuum is that in a perfect world this vacuum would be the best and also be about $100-$200.  That said, I have an easy time forgiving the cost when I see how much improved my day-to-day life is.  I can honestly say, this is probably the best $400 I have ever spent.  It took something I hated, and made it fun.  And my house is ACTUALLY clean for the first time in the 2 years we've owned it.Synopsis- If you are tired of dealing with vacuum cleaners that lose suction, replacing broken belts, smelling fried engines, missing half the hair or dust in your house, not having the proper material to clean your entire house with one product, or of spending hundreds of dollars over the years on vacuums that simply don't work- stop debating and buy a Dyson!  It's the best decision you'll ever make, and I promise you won't regret it.  What you'll find is, after getting past the difficulty of parting with your money, your life will be much improved.  I will say, make sure you check multiple dealers for the best deal- when we were looking, Maxvacuum had the best deal, slightly cheaper than Amazon with free shipping, no tax, and even a free 'cleaning kit' thrown in which added another 4 attachments and a heavy duty spot remover.  Good luck, and I wish you good decisions!"

A couple of questions occurred to me while researching this device: Why would a simple vacuum cost so much money and is Dyson just marketing towards rich dumb people and recently married couples with too many gift cards to blow through? Well after using the Dyson on most of the carpets in my home I can tell you that it is indeed a fantastic device and not just a hyped up gadget for financially irresponsible people. It picked up a ridiculous amount of cat hair (granted, we do have pretty gross house that we rarely clean) that I was able to see whipping around inside the collection canister like a furry tornado. I was planning on just testing the vacuum on just one room but it was so satisfying to see how much stuff was being collected that I did the rest of the carpets in the house and ended up with a canister of 100 kilomartys worth of hair. I also accidentally destroyed a bra that was on the bedroom floor but that is just a testament to the power of this machine. Another nice feature is the HEPA filter- while running the machine I didn't sneeze or smell any dust in the air. The Dyson ball is extremely well designed- the buttons are in convenient places, it contours around corners, and the built-in wand pops on and off the base of the main unit like a domesticated Transformer. The design of the wand could only be improved if it was shaped like the proton guns from Ghostbusters. In summation, I give the Dyson Ball 4 out of 5 stars. It is a powerful and well designed device but looses a star because of its high price and because my wife and I are trying to conceive and it made me ejaculate twice while she was at work."

They all said I wouldn't regret spending this kind of money on a vacuum cleaner.  They were absolutely right!I honestly can't believe I spent this much for a vacuum cleaner.  I just bought all new kitchen appliances and this was more expensive than my new range or dishwasher, and very comparable to the cost of my new refrigerator!  But I 'sucked it up' and bought it.  Amazon had the best price by far, either online or in-store anywhere.As an experiment, I used my old Eureka vacuum cleaner on my area rug in the living room.  A day later I used the Dyson DC25 and it picked up SO MUCH DIRT!!  I actually had to empty the container twice just vacuuming that area rug.  I could not believe all that dirt and cat hair had been left behind by my old vacuum cleaner all these years.  It was disgusting.  I have my 2 bedrooms carpeted with wall-to-wall, and again I had to empty the Dyson container multiple times, which is a GOOD thing!  I was absolutely amazed at how much it picked up, and everyone was right, I do not regret buying this vacuum cleaner.  My house will be a lot cleaner from now on.It was fairly easy to put together and it's very easy to empty the container (this might sound geeky but it's actually FUN to empty it and see all the crap it picked up!).

I've tried all the inexpensive vacuums because I couldn't convince my husband that with vacuums, you get what you pay for. Finally, with the Dyson, he now sees my point, literally. I had to empty the container twice in each room to start with but now that's down to once for two rooms. The only downsides are the short cord, the small dust container and the I find the wand a bit awkward. I seems as though Dyson was trying to make this machine really small and light weight to be easier for owners with two story houses and small apartments. It does that beautifully, but it did cut down on the size dust container they could put on this small machine. I love it's weight and manuverability, but if it was slightly larger it would still be lighter and more agile than standard machines and it would hold more. As for the cord, that's just cheaping out. It wouldn't have cost them 50 cents to have added a few feet to make it of standard length. Over all I'm delighted with it's cleaning ability. It also switches from carpet to hard floors easily. The little spinning brush head tool that comes with the Animal works very well. Better than comparable ones I've used. Just vary the pattern until all the fur comes up. If you need to clean up after multiple critters, this is the machine."

Back peddle (release for vacuuming and standing up) malfunctioned. Hose stopped working (no there was no clog), ball jammed etc. Dyson and I are on a first name basis. Be aware their warranty only covers 'defective parts'..as defined by THEM.You have to fight for service. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have a 50 yr old Hoover that works better than this junk.

Lives up to everything you've heard!I test-drove a Dyson Animal DC28 the day after my vacuum broke (and it broke after vacuuming) and I was disgusted & embarrassed by the volume of dirt and yuk (and hair from my Attack Sheltie).I then compared the Dyson Animal DC25 to the DC28, and chose the DC25 for these reasons:Weight--the DC25 is 16 pounds -- 4 pounds lighter than the 25 lbs on the DC28.  The motor is in the ball, so its low center-of-gravity makes it feel lighter.Ball Technology--again, lives up to the hype for maneuverability, and allows you to get into the corners.  Learning to 'steer' is intuitive.Some of the cons you might think of:Suction and amperage--the DC28 has 1 more amp, and suction power is 25 greater.  BUT, I bought my DC25 one day after vacuuming with the DC28, and picked up even more yuck and hair and dirt.Cleaning path width -- the DC28 is 1.5' bigger.  You might think this would decrease your cleaning time.  The reality is that the Ball decreases your cleaning time. Also, the smaller head seems to fit into and under more things.Cord length -- the DC25 cord length is 24.6', while the DC28 is 35.2'.  For me, a longer cord means more tangles.Dirt Catch bucket -- half the size. (.31 vs .61)That's why I chose the DC25 over the DC28."

Spend the extra dollars, you will be as impressed as I.  I had an expensive Kenmore Progressive Intell-iclean, besides being heavy as concrete, it lost most of it's cleaning power over a few years. Even after an overhaul it wasn't picking up properly.  I bought the DC25 Animal and first vacuumed my bedroom carpet with my old vacuum. then vacuumed with the Animal - SOLD hands down. Not only does my carpet look clean, the contents of the Animal dirt bin was astounding. Not just how much, but what!  I though because of the roller brush I would find a lot of carpet fibers but not at all, I found so much human hair, pet hair, dander, just plain dust and dirt.Contrary to reviews of struggles to assemble, if you can match a picture to an object, it snaps together in minutes with no trouble and is ready to go.  My stone and carpet floors have never felt so clean, been so clean.  Great design + great performance + great value = DYSON. Get one, today and it will make you feel clean, if not down right happy!"
"807","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","July 6, 2010","A29JUMRL1US6YP","Happy with my Dyson","After we moved to our new house, our old vacuum started to lose suction and eventually lost it completely.  We have three cats and a dog, so it's very important that we have a great vacuum.  We bought the Dyson DC25 Animal Ball about a month ago to replace the old vacuum, and I have been very happy with it so far.PROS* Lightweight / compact design - I know some have said that they think it's heavy, but I guess it's all relative.  This vacuum is much lighter than any other vacuum I've had before.  I have no problem carrying it up and down our tight spiral staircase.  The compact design makes the machine easy to store.  The extension wand slides inside the back of the machine and doubles as the handle, which declutters the machine.* Great suction - I think this model has plenty of suction and does a great job cleaning our carpets.  ~ Some have complained about their suction and about the machine not 'fluffing' their carpet.  We have berber carpeting throughout our home, so maybe the machine works better on dense carpet or carpeting with a low pile.  In any case, this machine is far better than our old machine that sucked at sucking.* Canister - The canister fits well against the machine's gasket, so nothing leaks through.  The canister is also easy to empty; a trigger releases the bottom and the waste falls into your trash can.  ~ Some have complained about pet hair getting stuck in the canister, but I don't find this to be a problem.  It's just the nature of the beast.  I would rather have the hair in the canister than on my carpet.  ~ Some reviewers say that the canister is too small.  My last vacuum's canister was only slightly larger and that machine was much bigger/bulkier.  The compact design of the Dyson may limit the capacity of the canister, but I don't mind dumping it more often.* Maneuverability - The ball design really does make this machine easier to maneuver.  It turns on a dime and cuts down the length of time it takes to vacuum the house.  My mother has the Dyson Animal model without the ball, and when she visited and used my machine, she said that she wished she had gotten the one with the ball because it was much easier to use.CONS* Cord length - The cord on my last vacuum was very long, so in comparison, this one seems short.  I can still vacuum at least a whole room without moving to a new outlet, so it could be worse.* Attachment storage - not all of the attachments can be stored on board the machine.In the end, I love this machine and it does a great job cleaning my carpets."
"808","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","July 6, 2010","A2WLH2A2Z5N4G2","Best vacuum on earth!!!","The ball is everything it claims to be and the 'never loses suction' advertisement is true as well.I read a lot of reviews saying that the vacuum is really loud... NOT THE CASE!!!The only thing I will say is there is NO difference between the animal version and the all-floors models except with the animal one you get an extra accessory. Go yellow unless you want to pay extra for the color purple :)I looked all over the web for this vacuum and amazon's price is by fare the cheapest you will find (Having Prime was clutch)."
"809","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","July 3, 2010","A36YX0YW6PCQJL","Buy it!!!","I honestly cant figure out why there are 12 one star reviews for this vacuum.  It actually scared me a little bit but we ended up buying the vacuum anyway.  And wow am I glad that we did!  This vacuum is awesome!  I have never felt like we can walk around barefoot in our house without having to wipe our feet off constantly. We have a huge german shepherd who sheds like crazy and two cats.  We are also extremely busy and we dont sweep as much as we should.  However, the broom is now out in the garage because there is absolutely no need for a broom anymore!  We have beautiful new hardwoods and I was always terrified to use a vacuum on the floor because I was afraid it would get scratched, but since the Dyson can easily turn off the brushes I never have to sweep again.  The floor feels so clean its crazy.  Oh yeah it also works wonders on dog beds and rugs and carpet.I would complain that it is rather pricey... but we got it for $379 on sale.  So I definitely feel good about the value.  It also DOES pick up small items, like say cat food or cat litter.  It also DOES not release clouds of dirt like another reviewer mentioned.  I also love that you dont have to bend down, all of the controls are high enough on the vacuum that there is very little bending.  So what if you have to clean out the canister more often?  Its only because its picking up more dirt than your old vacuum and since its so easy to do.... who cares?The only thing I wish is that it would also mop my floor at the same time... now that would be awesome!"

I had one problem about a year ago where the vacuum would not turn off - once I unplugged it and called customer service (calling them was no trouble and they helped me right away. I emailed first, and did not get a response for several days, by then the issue was resolved, so calling is the faster service) they were great! Instead of sitting on hold they have an option where they call you back, and in no time I was speaking with a very nice lady (she spoke English!). She talked me through fixing it on the phone, and even got a model of my vacuum in front of her so she knew what buttons I was referring to - everything was quick and painless. Plus it has not messed up since!Just so you know what this vacuum has to deal with- I have very long hair, have 4 100lb dogs in and out of the house, previous owners used carpet power like it was going out of style, live in the country with sandy soil, and have an affinity for going barefoot outside to visit my husband laying on the ground working on manlyprojects - all of which means a very hard time on a cleaner.

However, carrying it up and down stairs and banging it around I did break a connection that made it not work as well as usual.  Instead of putting money into fixing it I was happy to buy the newest model.  I love this vacuum.  I feel like the Windows commercial when I talk about it, 'My name is Ann, I'm  a vacuum and the new Dyson Animal was my idea.'  Every change that was made to this model makes it better and easier to use.  This is not just a great feat of engineering, it is great industrial design.  The changes to the upholstery hose are just what I needed.  The Ball makes it so easy to maneuver and it feels so smooth on any surface.  It is also much lighter and easier to carry.  I love the new brush and the washable filter.  I have not had to deal with the cost and annoyance of bags since owning a Dyson.  I do not work for the company but if they designed a car, I would buy it in a heartbeat. I think Toyota should learn from the Dyson design team.  I plan on buying the Dyson fan after watching the video.Ordering from Amazon was the best.  Best price($424)  and quick and free delivery.

As far as other complaints I've read about:1. Removed fibers from carpet; My carpets are old and any fibers I found were minimal.2. Bin too small; I can deal with that.3. Wire too short; Unless you live in a large mansion, in which case you probably have someone do your vacuuming, a shorter cord is better in my mind, especially if it isn't retractable, which this isn't.

Right out of the box it snapped together so easily (and I'm terrible at putting stuff together).  It was a breeze.  The ball makes it glide around on the floor and into places that a regular vacuum wouldn't go.  I think it's also quieter than your average vacuum, and therefore, my dog doesn't go quite so beserk and bark like crazy every time I turn it on.  Within minutes of turning it on for the first time, it had sucked up a half a cannister of dog hair (and our carpet is nearly new so I really feel like it must have sucked up every last piece of hair!). One attachment works awesome at getting the dog hair(pug/beagle mix) off of my microfiber couch and another is great at sucking dog hair and dust off of flat surfaces.  The cannister is super easy to empty.  I could go on, but really, if you've had it with the dog hair this really is a wonderful product.  My only tiny, tiny complaint is that when you pull the attachment out it's a little bit too long which makes it just a little difficult to handle.  Not a big deal.  Well worth the money.

I thought this may make it interesting to vacuum around it while it's up, easily being able to follow the turns of the tracks and such.And while the rollerball does make it turn differently, I have to say I didn't see any real benefit to it over a 'normal' vacuum.  But that fact didn't detract from the rating, since overall this is still one of the best vacuums I've ever used, just as all the dyson line seem to be.Suction is outstanding, and consistent.  Even when the canister is half filled with goop, it still pulls and pulls.It's very easy to move around, since this one is actually smaller than the previous dyson models I had.  The attachments were an improvement too, including the pull out extension.  In my previous models, I had to push a large release catch to 'unlock' the upright part that separates into the wand and extension.  This one it just comes up without any release, but does not come off unintentionally.  Simply pulling out the extension wand simultaneously unlocks the handle so it comes up too.  Push it all back into place, and it's once again locked.  No manual release catch needed.As with all of them, the ease of emptying the unit is only marred by the receptacle you're dumping it into often letting dust waft up...  It's a good thing when the worst complaint about emptying your vacuum is the performance of the GARBAGE CAN rather than the vacuum!beater bar works very well, a little TOO well as evinced by an ipod cable of mine that got yanked in the VERY FIRST TIME I used this thing...  So my clear plastic shield over the beater bar now has a white mark where the usb jack end of the cable was squeezed through by the high power spinning bar...  Don't let animals or small children too near it ;)The locking and unlocking of the stand behind the ball is simple, just a toe release lever and those supporting back wheels fold away. Simply push the handle back to an upright position and they come down again and securely catch.  There's no doubt that they lock in place, you can hear and feel it.And when you're moving it from place to place, not vacuuming, those little back wheels are easy enough to push it along with, even over carpet dividers and edges where the metal strip holds the carpet secure where it joins up next to tile and such.Outstanding unit, and i'm every bit as pleased with it as I was with any prior Dyson purchase."

After reading all of the reviews and trying to decide which Dyson vacuum to buy, the DC17, DC23 or DC25 we went with the DC25 Animal. ( We have 2 cats, so the animal promised a better job with the attachment for furniture and pet beds. It has a rotating brush in the attachment head.) We were very hesitant to purchase the DC25 because it had some negative reviews about suction and the size of the dirt holding tank. We received our new vacuum today, the day after we just had our carpets professionally cleaned. Had to test it out and was shocked how much hair and stuff was sucked up considering the carpet cleaners used a commercial vacuum and their cleaning equipment just the day before! Any of the reviews that said the suction was not good I think are not correct. Also the size of the tank was a little small but I imagine after doing the house with a good vacuum a couple of times you won't need to empty as much. We had to empty the bucket 3 times but did all of the furniture and cat beds also. The bucket is easy to empty, the attachments are easy to use, the animal attachment did do a way better job on furniture and pet beds than the regular brush attachment. The vacuum did everything we wanted it to and more. I am very satisfied and pleased with the product so far."

I live in the desert, on land, outside of Tucson, AZ. The wind really blows the sand & dust here. I have gone through 2 vacuums in the 6 yrs that I have been here. That powder fine dust just clogs them up & kills them. The Dyson is so powerful.  *At first I found the process of releasing the extension wand/hose awkward but now I am a quick draw.I also ordered several attachments as the description did not say exactly what came with it (or I did not notice).  *The flexible crevice tool is perfect for the tracks on my sliding glass doors they are frequently full of sand. It works wonderful for this. I used to have to go after it with a tooth brush for the crevice tool to pick up with my old vacuum.  *The soft dusting attachment is perfect dusting everything around the house for a quick job or before actually cleaning, oiling & dusting with cloths. Really gets the dirt off first.  *The stiff bristle brush is great for baseboards, lamp shades & furniture.LOVE THIS VACUUM!"

I definitely had reservations about spending this amount of money on a vacuum cleaner, but it has shown that it is worth it. We have two cats and the Dyson DC25 picks up enough cat hair each week to make two more cats. It is really satisfying to be able to see everything that is being pulled out of your carpet and being able to throw it in the garbage. I did lots of research and I just couldn't get away from how much everybody seemed to like their Dyson and now I know why. The only complaint I would have if I were forced is that everything is plastic, which seems to be the way all vacuums are now.

The only draw back I had while assembling this was trying to figure out how to remove the extension wand but after I figured it out I was impressed on how simple it was and how dumb I was.Everything about this vacuum is centered around simplicity. Like emptying the canister and not worrying about replacing filters. Also the onboard tools are simple to attach and detach.Of course the main purpose of getting this vacuum was because of the picking up ability. I was not disappointed! Even though I had previously vacuumed the day before I had the canister to it's max line after only minutes of use. I have 2 cats and so there's always plenty of hair in the carpet and this DC 25 picked up every single bit of it. Overall I'm happy about it's performance especially since I was able to get the allergy kit for free as a promotional deal normally $69.00.

I wondered how long it would take me to adapt to the ball, but it all came so easy. It is a lot quieter than my old machine too. The only disappointment is the size of dirt collection bin. If I want to do a good job I have to empty it at least four times because all the dog hair gets stuck and stops spinning. When it gets really dirty from the dust and dirt I can rinse it out.

It does everything it says it will do and does it well.  It is a very good vacuum cleaner, the best I have ever used.  We have a long-haired German Shepherd and this machine handles the job well.  It also works well on our wood floors.  It is also light weight and easy to maneuver.  Did I tell you we really like the ball?THE WEIRD:  The attachments remind you that it is a Euro design.  Not sure if Lord Dyson just wanted to be original but he would have been better served to keep things simple when it comes to the attachment design.  What I am referring to is how the handle for the entire unit is a tube that detaches from the unit with different latches and snaps to become the wand.  The problem is if you want to move the unit around while you are using the attachment, there is no handle as it now in your hand with the hose attached to it instead of being attached to the unit.  It takes some getting used to for sure.  In summary the attachments work well and just take a while to get the hang of.  If you use attachments a lot, I recommend you look at one of these machines and fiddle with the attachments in a local store before you purchase it 'sight unseen' online.We ended up saving a little bit off the Amazon price by purchasing our DC25 animal at Bed Bath & Beyond with a 20% off coupon we got for registering for their mailing list.  We are happy with our purchase and recommend it to anyone who can handle paying a little more money for a good vacuum."

At the time the baby was just beginning to crawl, our old vacuum cleaner (a Dirt Devil, and a piece of garbage if there ever was one) was starting to die.  It would pick up everything (eventually) but the carpet never really looked clean.I decided to pitch the old vacuum and invest in a new one.  After much research, I chose the Dyson Animal.  I gulped a bit at the price, but decided that I'd at least try it out; after all, I'd bought the much cheaper Dirt Devil twice, and both times, it had completely stunk.I was sold after five minutes.  By ten minutes, I was convinced it was one of the best household purchases I'd ever made.  I'm still of that opinion today, five months later.I could not believe how easy the Animal was to use.  It went places our old upright would never go, and did so with ease.  It was actually fun to vacuum!  That first day, I'd just intended to vacuum our living room, and twenty minutes later, I was halfway across the house, still marveling at what I was getting up.I'd just vacuumed the day before...but the first time I ran the Animal, I had to stop twice in each room to empty the canister.  I was appalled at how much dirt and hair still lingered on an apparently clean carpet!  The extension is so easy to use, too - I felt as if I never really had to break stride to use it, so I was much more inclined to do detail cleaning than I had been.It's incredibly lightweight, especially compared to my old uprights, and extremely manuverable.  We've yet to have any of the perennial belt problems we used to have.  Also, while I do have to empty the canister frequently, I'm also able to sprinkle some lavender buds into the canister to lend a lovely fresh odor while I vacuum.  I also like seeing what I'm picking up.  I rescued an earring just the other day.  In our old bag upright, that would have been lost.Bottom line:  Buy this, especially if you live in a place with a lot of dust or with animals.  You absolutely will not be sorry."

The suction on the hand wand is pretty good, but the brushing power is average at best. I've read that they lowered the amps in the newer models.

Here are my thoughts for anyone considering this purchase.I LOVE...* Its lightweight.* Super easy to manuever - was unsure about the ball when I ordered but SO glad I did.* This thing sucks - for real.  Its like it eats hair and dirt and loves it.* The long handle is nice for reaching above my head (I'm 5'3' so this is important for cleaning ceilings, etc.* The mini turbine works and works well.  My old vacuum had one that died shortly after purchase and was impossible to unclog.  This one works just as well as the floor head.* The canister is easy to empty.I WOULD CHANGE...* I think that the canister should be bigger.  I'm a clean/germ freak. Each room of my house gets vacuumed twice a day so there can't be that much to suck up, and I still feel like I'm emptying the canister too much.* I don't like that the mini turbine has no place to attach to the vacuum. It is so usable and something I use in every room I wish I could take it with me.  I solved this though by buying a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey and using its purple velvet bag to carry my mini turbine. Its the perfect size and the purple matches the vacuum. I just loop the bag over the small attached crevice tool.  Looks a little redneck, but it works!* Feel like the transition from normal vacuuming to handheld tools is a little clumsy and was sort of difficult to get the hang of at first.CONCLUSION:  I would certainly purchase this vacuum again, but will look for more upgrades and 'fixes' to the things I don't like in future models. Still the best vacuum I've ever had and I've had several.If you have any specific questions that you would like my opinion on, please comment and I will reply to you, usually same day."

I also love the way this vacuum turns and operates with the ball design, it gets places I could not get before.

I think I enjoy using more then she does! The experience with the DC31 made us consider the DC25 Animal. The DC25 is really light and maneuverable, which makes my wife want to use it more. The day it arrived from Amazon I was so excited to try it out I started vacuuming immediately, and it was a lot of fun to use.

Since buying it, I happen to have been to 2 vacuum repair shops with my mother's vacuum and both repair men told me to stay away from the Dyson and that they get lots in the shop for repair. Both repair men recommended sticking with vacuums that use bags, not the bagless kind. (Unfortunately, this was after my Dyson purchase!)I love the concept of the ball and it is easy to maneuver around furniture and in tight spaces. I would not say it particularly sucks any better than my old vacuum however (which was a Hoover Windtunnel). It does seem lighter and quieter than my old vacuum though.What I don't like about it are the tools. They seem very awkward to use and difficult to 'angle' and maneuver in tight spots. Also, once the tools are in use, you are left with a strange plastic upright 'handle' to push the vacuum, which is not comfortable to hold. I've also noticed that it's easy to pinch your skin with the tubing while using the tools.Overall, I think it looks cool, but it's probably overrated.

I'd heard a lot of great things about the Dyson vacuum cleaners and after hours of reading reviews, both good and bad, decided to purchase one. I had been very reluctant because of the price of the Dyson, but managed to find a new one at a significant discount. The assembly was an easy 1-2-3 process (literally) and I had it running in less than 5 minutes after unboxing it. It is light-weight and much quieter than I'd expected considering the power it possesses. It easily picked up loads of dirt from my smaller rugs in the foyer~~I'd read a few reviews that claimed it would 'suck up' the rug, but I didn't have that problem with my rugs. Next, I tackled the hard-wood floors. With the beater-brush turned off, it cleaned everything in sight without the old problem I'd had with my former vac where it would throw the dirt and debris out the back and scatter it everywhere. It got into the corners and laid down flat enough to get under my kitchen table. I live on a farm and a lot of dirt gets dragged in daily, so it wasn't surprising that during the vacuuming of three large area rugs, I had to empty the canister three times. My old vacuum apparently wasn't doing much good! Did well on persian/oriental rugs without evident harm; just loads of dirt. I also own a parrot who makes a tremendous mess with his feathers, powder down and food. This vacuum sucked up even the smallest of downy feathers if I got to within a few inches of them on the hardwood. Next, I tried out the smaller hand attachment for use on furniture. It has its own rotating brush for picking up cat/dog hair (have two dogs and a cat as well). With other vacs, the moment you apply the  attachment to the furniture, the brush bogs down. Not this one! It picked up every cat hair off a chair I'd gone over several times with an attachment on my old vac. I must say, I am certainly satisfied with every aspect of this vacuum cleaner. Finally, I'll be able to reach up and get the cobwebs off the ceiling beams that I just couldn't get to with my smaller vacuum hose. The Dyson's wand extends to places I'd not been able to reach without a 12-foot ladder in the past. Definitely worth every penny. Shop around and get one for less~~they're out there. My sister has a refurbished one and is equally happy with hers."

My old vacuum could never get the dirt out of the low squares.  The DC25 cleaned it like a pro.  It performed just as well on the low squares as it did on the high ones.  Afterward, I vacuumed my bedroom carpet and the Dyson picked up all of the gunk my old vacuum kept spitting out.  It did an excellent job around the base boards and cleaned dirt from the edges even without the crevice tool.  Love, love, love this vacuum!I then tried it out on my hardwood floors.  The beater bar button is conveniently located on the front so I didn't have to bend down to switch it off.  (Okay, I'm only 5'2', but still...) Our lower floor is all hardwood but we have several rugs on the floor.  I needed a vacuum that could switch between the two quickly and easily.  The Dyson had it covered.  Press once and the beater bar switched off, press again and it was back on.  Loved it!  It picked up dust and dirt as well as larger bits of dry cat food.  My floors passed the bare feet test and I didn't feel any grit or residue left behind. With two kids and two cats, that's a miracle.  The vacuum performed beyond my expectations.As others have mentioned, the ball makes cornering a breeze.  I could maneuver around chairs and other furniture with ease.  I did have to switch outlets a couple of times, but I've never had a vacuum cord long enough to cover the whole house so I'm used to that.  The dust bin emptied with a touch of a button and nothing got caught in the bin requiring manual removal.I just purchased this vacuum today so I can't speak to its durability, but so far it has been worth every penny."

Reading past reviews, I saw that people were disappointed, however I do believe that they were expecting more due to brand association and price. I have used a Kirby Legend II, the Hoover Platinum and a in home central vacuum system. Compared the the Kirby it is much lighter and easier to use, the Kirby also has to have regular belt and bag changes. The Kirby is a very powerful machine, but for it's size and weight you would expect that. Overall the Kirby was/is much more expensive but had quality you could feel. The Hover Platinum is the closest vacuum that could compare to the Dyson. The brush head and canister are larger, and the cord is longer, these points alone made me almost purchase that instead. It also has an indicator light that lets you know if the carpet in clean or dirty, a novelty item, but fun to watch. What sold me on the Dyson was the ball and the ease of maneuvering and pivoting. The house vacuum is just convenient and will spoil you. However it is very expensive and is usually installed while the house is being built. The best thing about the house vacuum is the option of having suction levers along the baseboards around the house where you please. The kitchen is a great place to have one, if there is a small spill, just flip the lever, grab a broom and sweep it in the wall. No vacuum can compare in my opinion. With that said, the Dyson is a less expensive option that is comparable in terms of convenience. I also own a Roomba, which is a lifesaver, especially when it comes to an easy daily vacuuming all around the house and leaving the deep vacuuming to once a week. If you own a pet or keep or windows open often, get a Roomba. Overall I would recommend this vacuum. It is light, effortless, convenient and good looking too. My only complaint is the plastic used, I would have thought it would have been thicker and denser, but that is what makes it so light, however I would have rather had denser plastic than a lighter vacuum."

I read all the reviews for months before deciding to make my purchase and I couldn't be happier. My house has a combination of hardwood floors, Berber carpeting, plush area rugs, and tile and it does an excellent job in all places. It's great at picking up crumbs and sand my children bring in, household dust, and the animal fur left behind by my cat and two dogs. I have an area rug that no vacuum seemed capable of getting the matted-in fur off of, and the Dyson Animal sucked it up with no problem. The canister is a bit small, but I only have to empty it once, sometimes twice, when vacuuming my 1100 SF house. The cord is a bit on the short side as well, but even with a longer cord, I tend to unplug my vacuum and replug it in a couple of times while cleaning. The only real issue I have is that the hose can be a bit awkward to use with the long handle attachment on it.I saw some people complain that the brushes on the spinning part have damaged their hardwood floors. I have not had that problem. As long as the vacuum is in it's locked, upright position and I'm not pushing it, the brushes don't start spinning and I'm able to manually turn them off. The vacuum has even survived accidently running over shoelaces and Legos without any damage. My old Hoover Windtunnel broke any time I ran over anything that wasn't dust.The vacuum is super light weight and really easy to carry and maneuver when using. It was completely worth the $550 price tag (especially considering the 5 year warranty)."

We have a dog and 2 cats and a couple of rooms with carpet that no other vacuum we owned would clean lint and hair from.  We had to use lint brushes!  This vacuum cleaned every last piece of hair and lint off the rug and we just stood there amazed!  However, there are some pros and cons to weigh here.Pros:  1.  It cleans like a maniac!  2.  The dirt bin empties from the bottom, so no more turining it upside down and spilling half the dirt on your floor before you get to the garbage can.  3.  Best feature is when you put the vacuum in upright position, the beater bar stops moving, so no more wearing down your carpet while you move that coffee table. 4.  My husband really likes the ball technology.  I think it's ok.Cons:  1.  The cleaning wand is difficult to remove.  It sometimes takes 2 hands, plus a foot to hold down the rest of the vacuum before it will cooperate.  2.  The cleaning wand, in our opinion is too long and makes it difficult to maneuver in tight corners and on stairs. 3.  The handle is not very comfortable when you have to vacuum for long periods of time.  It could use a different shape, or more rounded edges so it's not rubbing on your thumb.If the cleaning action stays as strong as promised, this will be the best vacuum I've ever owned.  Only time will tell."

That being said, the Dyson is more than up to the task. Onto the new vac.......Pro's...New sleek design, improved tool design, more power with less noise (yes it's actually quieter) and the ball technology makes getting around so easy. Con's...they down sized the collection container, now it needs to be emptied a couple of times with the old one we could vac the whole upstairs and empty just once. They also shortened the electrical cord, not a major problem, but still something different. The quality of the build is mostly plastic, perhaps a concern, but the five year warranty gives peace of mind, I had never needed service with the old machine, I had some quetions and all were answered promptly and fully.

"870","XX","B001EFMD8W","2.0","February 16, 2010","A3U55E9UMNWWDD","Not for hardwood floors (unless you want them scratched)","Be aware that this vacuum cleaner has a major design flaw. It is designed to scratch hardwood floors by default because the brush turns on by default and there is no way to turn the vacuum on without the brush turning on automatically. It is only after the vacuum cleaner is switched on that you can press the button to turn the brush off. While this is happening the vacuum cleaner is scratching up the finish of the hardwood floor so over time you are going to see scratch marks created by the vacuum cleaner wherever you might have happened to turn the vacuum cleaner on. When I called to inquire if the brush operation is actually designed to scuff a finished hardwood floor each time the vacuum is turned on until I manually press the brush button to turn it off, I was told that that is in fact how the vacuum is designed. I was however offered the solution of placing the vacuum on a rug, turning it on and then manually turning the brush off, and then manually lifting and placing it on the finished hardwood floor. After spending $500, no thank you. This vacuum is going back where I bought it. I have to say though that the machine is very well made but due to the idiotic design of the brush switch, there is no way to turn the vacuum on without the brush turning on automatically. So this is a great vacuum cleaner if you have carpeted house but not suitable for homes with finished hardwood floors that would get scratched with the rotating brush. What a dissapointment!"

I had been using a bissle vaccum for about a year as with any simple machine it had no suction for deep carpet and on tile would just blow the dust and hair around instead of picking up. Our carpets were matted down from foot traffic and looked cruddy because of the children spilling and dogs dragging everything around. I had read others reviews and specs on this dyson and decided to go ahead. I can not explain the improvment this vacuum has made on our home. within a 5x5 section I had to empty the can twice because of all the dust it had picked up it was very visable in the clear can what the old vacuum had failed to do. After cleaning the whole house over i could breathe the differance and see it on our entertainment center. The Dyson was very easy to assemble just attach a few parts out of the box and go. It was even more simple to find all the inner workings and trouble shooting paths with the instructions. its a simple advanced piece of equipment. the only downfall if the canister size its capacity is limited but not difficult to empty two simple buttons and your back in business.

"875","XX","B001EFMD8W","2.0","January 27, 2010","AZD6DGC338YX7","Is not an improvement over DC17 Animal","I was very excited in purchasing this vacuum cleaner. Previously I've owned a DC17 Animal since it's been on the market, and it still functions great! Due to some changes in our living arrangements etc. we do not have that vacuum cleaner in the house anymore. So we thought this would be a great chance to 'upgrade' to a newer version of Dyson. We've always wanted to try out the ball, seemed much easier to handle on the commercials, and we knew the technology and swore by it. Our original thought was to get the DC15 Ball, but for some reason that was 'sold out' or 'not in stock' at every store I looked at, including Amazon. After careful research we went with the DC 25 Animal.Well, in short, we were disappointed in this particular model (DC 25 Animal). Though the machine might be the best find for many, it did not measure up to our expectations from the DC17.Pros:- Light weight- Easy to maneuver- Easy to clean out the binCons:- Poor suction power (over the original DC17 Animal)- Short power cord- Small dust binOverall, I could not understand why this machine shares the 'Animal' with the DC17, aside from the color being common. It seems that Dyson took away the actual value of a vacuum cleaner and tremendously improved it's handling and weight. To me the most important thing for a vacuum cleaner is it's suction power and ease of cleaning. Though the ball makes it easy to 'roll around' the room, the plugging and unplugging adds a hassle that previously was not there.I could also understand if Dyson says that this vacuum cleaner was not meant to be as powerful as the DC17 (eg. 11amps vs. 12amps). Being the same color with a higher numbered model(DC25) and the same product label (Animal) gives the impression that it's a newer and better version to the old Animal. Nowhere in the ads did I see that this had less suction power than the DC17.I would recommend this vacuum cleaner to those who have only hardwood/tile floors or berber carpet and/or thin/silk rugs.I would NOT recommend this vacuum cleaner to those who have plush carpeting and/or big rooms.Detailed review:As a background here's our setting, and the environment we use the vacuum in:Our home  has hardwood and tile on the first floor, plush wall to wall carpeting on the second floor and stairs, and berber carpeting in our family room. Our pet is a medium hair cat.Weight: 5 out of 5 StarsA HUGE plus. This one probably weighs about half of DC17! Awesome improvement! I was able to pick this one up at any time, take it up or down the stairs without any problems.Handling: 4 out of 5 StarsA plus. It's definitely at least as easy as it's shown in the commercials.It's very easy to handle and maneuver around any furniture, chairs,  walls etc. The only thing I found awkward was the way you have to get the lever to 'click' on the bottom before it actually stays where you put it. Then you have to step on the lever a certain way to release and use the vacuum. The DC17 was easier this way, as soon as you brought it to the upright position it clicked and stayed. This one you have to make an additional effort for that special click.Capacity: 3 out of 5 StarsThe Clear Bin is very small. To me this is indifferent. I can make do, I'd just would have to empty the bin after each use. Though I'd prefer the machine be able to 'adjust' to my way of doing things, this is an easy enough change in my habits. It's easy enough to empty.Suction Power: 2 out of 5 StarsThis was one of the causes for me to return this model. After the price tag and the DC17 Animal (which is 12amps as opposed to 11amps on this one), this model did not seem to do a fair job on our wall to wall plush carpets in the bedrooms. However, it did do a great job on the hardwood, the rugs and the berber carpet. I could see it picking up the cat hair, just like the DC17.One 'improvement' to the DC17 is, it would do the rugs without lifting them and sucking them up. Doing the edges and corners of the rugs, it did not catch the corners and get stuck. With the DC17 we would have to have somebody hold down the edges/corners so the machine wouldn't grab it.On the stairs, the weight was very helpful, I could carry it up to the landing without a problem. However, the power of the new attachment is not even close to the one that was on the DC17. The DC17 actually CLEANED the carpet on the stairs, this one did not. You couldn't even see the 'vacuum mark' on the carpet. I was less than impressed.CORD Length: 1 out of 5 StarsThe cord is very very very short. With the DC17 I was able to plug it in, in the outlet right at the middle of the floor and was able to do the WHOLE floor without having to unplug and replug. This one, I barely was able to get halfway through the room before the cord ran out! Not sure what the reason of having a shorter cord would be. It's not user friendly at all."

Bear with me while I tell the sad story with the happy ending.My first vacuum was a used truly ancient Hoover so old (but worked very well) it had the metal plate on the bottom that was easily removed with the flick of a turn style type large flat screw so the plate dropped off giving access to remove a jammed item or thread tangled around the roller or to change the belt.  Once belt changed, put plate on, turn large screw-Done. I wish I hadn't given it away.Since then I have owned 4 Hoovers.  With each constant 'what the hell is wrong with it now?', I would buy the next more expensive model hoping against hope that expense equaled RELIABILITY and EASE OF USE.  Alas it was not to be.  Over the years Hoover made it impossible to change a belt or remove a jam without using the tiniest of screwdrivers, spending hours taking the vacuum apart with dust flying everywhere and let's just say it is not surprising consumers are putting the local vacuum repairman's children though college.  There are vacuum repairs shops everywhere some quaintly called vacuum hospitals.  So there are 2 very expensive Hoovers in my garage with broken belts or some simple thing Hoover insists on making it impossible to easily remedy and the other 2 given away.  I am too cheap to give away the very expensive Hoovers and too stubborn to take them to a repair shop.  Between buying the Hoovers, I researched and purchased 2 Dirt Devils each more expensive than the other.  Like Hoovers, Dirt Devils are a pain in the rump to unjam and unlike Hoovers, they don't work as well.  I secretly wondered if vacuum manufacturers had stock in the repair shops.  So the Dirt Devils too sit in my garage.  I never purchased the cheapest vacuum model always mid-range up to the most expensive models.  Now understand, this vacuum accumulation is over 17 years and somewhere in there was the worst of vacuum of all - The Regina Housekeeper Plus which upon its maiden sweep, broke a belt or something. Off to vacuum hospital where the tech showed me a whole slew of Housekeepers, Hoovers, Dirt Devils, you name it lined up in his shop.  After the 3rd break in as many weeks and finding it impossible to find bags, The Housekeeper Plus was taken outside, smashed onto the sidewalk and dumped into the trash.  I used a broom and dust mop. (no carpeting in my house - tile and wood)With 2 older cats the broom method worked fine.  But in the last few years two stray kittens were adopted and the broom/dust mop method was no longer sufficient.  I spent HOURS researching vacuums/reading reviewer comments and no longer trusting Consumer Reports Magazine.  Spending hundreds of dollars on another crappy vacuum was NOT an option.  All I wanted was a vacuum that picked up cat hair/dander and dirt (as well as dog hair when my son and his dogs visited), was bagless ( I liked that in several of my Hoovers and one Dirt Devil) and something that little ole me could change a belt, unclog a jam and figure out what was wrong without a million tools or being rocket scientist.Answer: Dyson DC25 AnimalI jammed it within a week.  The handle would not go down.  Clenching my teeth, I saw a hose in the area where the handle refused to bend any longer. I easily unclasped the hose by squeezing the sides of the hose and out dropped a pen which wouldn't bend preventing the vacuum handle from going up.  NO BELTS that I can see and I have had mine for a year.  I ran over everything and everything was easily removed.  Several times the string on some cat toy or cord of a mini-blinds on my French door windows would wrap around the roller jamming it. Then came the real test.  While using the hose to vacuum around the cat bowls picking up stray hard cat food that spilled out of its bowl, the door bell rang.  Distracted, I accidentally ran the hose over a dish of wet Fancy Feast (Trout flavor) and the suction scooped some of it right up into the vacuum.  That gunked up the works and smelled like hell. Worse, the wet fishy Fancy Feast swirled around and mixed with the once dry Scoopable kitty litter that was vacuumed up around the cat box the day before. They call it CLUMPING for a reason. Having no time to clean it as I was called away, the Dyson was put away where the mess hardened and caked everywhere.  Surprisingly the vacuum still worked but the suction was down.  With much trepidation, Lysol cleaner, double rubber gloves, and most important of all a drywall sanding mask firmly in place, I went to work.  It was incredibly easy to remove the whole vacuum head, hoses, roller, and everything else because there was only a simple twist of one pair of plastic screws.  Dyson made access to every part EASILY reached and in no time the hose, roller, plastic roller casing (the underside of which was completely covered with gunk), etc. was sparkling clean.  I let it dry for a few hours, put it all back together in a snap and the vacuum works better than ever.I wreck vacuums.  But not a Dyson vacuum.Follow-Up June 2011 - I tore the hose reaching up CONSTANTLY to get the cobwebs in the corners of my EXTREMELY  high living room ceiling.  Once again, this was my fault, not the vacuum cleaner as I REALLY pulled the hose too many times and it finally gave.  I called Dyson to buy another hose and they said ONCE A YEAR you can call in and get one free part if a part breaks.  I received my 'free' hose last week.  Yet another reason to buy a Dyson.Follow-Up September - October - November 2012.  The hose is no longer reliable in suctioning. Sometimes it worked - sometimes it didn't.  I think it has to do with the foot pedal thing because if I lay the handle down and then lift it up a few times - sometimes the hose suction will return.  I was having eye issues so it was not a priority to call Dyson.  The brush floor part works great still.Follow-up January 2013  The brush stopped after I ran over a cell phone charger and the cord wrapped around the brush.  The vacuum stopped which it is supposed to do.  I unrolled the cord from the brush, hit red re-set button - nothing.  Hit the gray brush start button next to the red start button on handle - no luck.  Called Dyson.  My warranty runs out in 2013 and they are sending me a new brush area motor attachment (the whole area is one part for replacement.  Haven't received it yet - hope it fixes the brush problem.  At least the hose still works.Follow-up January 2013.  Hose does not work at all now.  I guess I wreck vacuums after all.  I cleaned the filter, I took the hoses off and checked for junk that may be stuck somewhere - nothing.FOLLOW -up January 2013 Dyson sent me another complete brush head (still under 5 year warranty) and I popped the old one off when I could see again after surgery (Blind from cataracts before) and the brush works now.  Hose suction still way down or way up - unreliable and Dyson authorized me to take the vacuum to a repair shop.  I think it has something to do with how the handle goes up and down.  I found a clear plastic piece after my eye surgery that 'might' below to the vacuum bottom.  I'll take it with me when dropping off the vacuum."

Yes, it can suck dirt you never knew existed in your carpet but what we have learned over several years of use is that this beautiful piece of purple engineering is flawed in many ways. First, the hose was replaced twice for cracking. Always at our expense. Keep in mind that we aren't using the thing commercially, just your average once a week cleaning. Then the clear plastic handle that you carry the heavy unit by when going upstairs cracked and finally broke completely off. Sadly that wasn't even the worst part. Shortly after that broke, the thin PLASTIC piece that holds the handle to the unit which you use to release the wand broke off making vacuuming with this extremely expensive machine virtually impossible. Of course all of this happened just past the warranty date.For such a well designed vacuum, Dyson could have done a much better job engineering the parts of the machine that you kind of take for granted like the handles. I had a $75 bag vacuum that lasted for 12 years and actually was still going strong but have two big dogs and thought the Animal was needed. I would have expected a $550 machine to last longer than 5.5 years.Buy at your own risk."

It seemed as though I never vacuumed my place.I saw more minute dust particles colored sandy white compared to other vacuumed dusts.Ever since then, vacuuming became one of my favorite activities of a day.1. Quality of vacuum  ; I usually take a couple of steps when I vacuum - Pet hair remover & brush, vacuum, wet-cloth wiping, vacuum.  With Dyson DC 25, I can skip front two steps and get the same result which often takes a half amount of time to do the same job.  Dyson DC25 does not give off the typical dusty smell of vacuuming.  If I do, the filter must be cleaned or emptied.  As long as I follow the recommended maintenance process, it works consistently and strongly.2. Handling  ; Enough weight to hold down the vacuum without flipping accidents or feeling that I'm just grazing the floor or carpet.3.

I ended up returning it, but only because it didn't pick up well on my kitchen floor.  All it did, was push around cheerios, chips, or whatever other food my kids dropped.  It sucked up dust, etc very well.  But any food particles, it would just not suck up.  I tried it a few times, cuz I really wanted it to work.  At one point I thought it picked up everything, then I turned it off and went to move the vacuum and everything fell out the bottom. It picked up on the carpet fine.  I'm not sure it was any better than any other vacuum though.Overall I guess if you just have carpet and want the maneuverability then this is a good investment.  I loved the ball concept.

But I kept reading reviews on line & my sis & friends all swore by it so I bit the bullet and bought the animal/ball.  BEST PURCHASE I ever made!! You don't realize how much dust is in your house until you use the dyson. I always thought my floors were clean (mind you we don't wear shoes indoors). The Dyson is worth every penny. The suction CLEANS EVERYTHING! And the ball technology isn't hype. It fantastic. Vacuuming around tables,chairs, corners ... soooo easy to do.

Before I go out and buy another one, I spent several weeks researching and finally settled on Dyson DC25 Animal.  I bought it based on the numerous positive review from customers who has one, and because of the great warranty that comes with it.  I also like DC25 design.  It's light enough for my wife and I to move it up and down between first and third floor of our home.  The additional motorized brush can be used to clean car seats and carpet and it did not add that much more to the cost of the original DC25.  The vacuum cleaner arrived yesterday.  My 4 year old daughter and I unpacked the box and put it together.  First thing I noticed after turning it on for the first time was that the noise level, unlike that of my old Bissell, was not so loud as to scare off my daughter like the Bissell did.  Secondly, vacuuming from rug to hardwood floor to thick padding carpet felt smooth, light, and easily maneuverable around furnitures.  It was so easy that my 4 year old, who wanted to be so helpful, was able to vacuum most of our bedroom on her own without any assistance from me.  Another thing that I noticed that when I had the DC25 up against the wall, it actually pick up the dust on the edge of the wall.  My old Bissell that supposedly had a built in 'edge to edge technology' couldn't do that even when it was brand new.  We always had to go over the edge along the wall using the attachment.  I was surprised how much dust and what not that it pulled.  I had to empty out the canister after vacuuming couple of bedrooms.  It goes to show just how little our old Bissell cleaned.  I am thoroughly impressed with the DC25 animal.  $599 is a steep price tag for a vacuum cleaner.  If you search around like I did, you can find it for less.  I got it for $469 with free shipping.  I got it a week after I ordered it."

It was so cool looking and easy to manuver.  I eagerly turned on the machine and made a few easy strokes..... huh? Something must be wrong.  It didn't even erase the footprints in the carpet and the suction was ok at best.  I switched off the brush bar and looked in the end, nothing was wrong.  I called customer service and after about 15 minutes on the phone with them figured out it was working properly. What the heck?I expected this thing to suck so hard that it would lift the carpet and create perfecty groomed rows of nap...like a freshly plowed field.  Not even close it barely even combed the top of the fibers.Problem #1-No height adjustment for the brush bar.  It barely even touches the carpet.  Not enough to even give you that 'just vacuumed' look.  Talk about a suction leak.Problem #2-It doesn't have very good sucking power.  My old Bissel sucked 2x as hard as this dyson.  Even the guy on the customer care line said it only moved about 50CFM of air compared to my old vacuum that moved much much more.Don't belive the marketing hype.  It's not worth the money.  Ever wonder why consumer reports ranks the cleaning ability of the Dyson as average?  Because it is.  Consumer reports is dead on in their review.  It's just not that good of a cleaner.Sure it looks cool and you can park it in the driveway to impress your neighbors... but as far as cleaning my carpets, this vacuum sucks - Not in a good way.I took it back to the store a few hours later and got my money back.

We cleaned our carpet after our Bissell and Hoover vacuums broke down, and the amount of dirt it picked up was phenomenal! It cleaned the hard wood really well too, and after the Hoover Windtunnel, in which we had to switch the cleaning from carpet to harwood everytime, this was a piece of cake. The only drawbacks were the frequency with which we had to empty the trash container and the shortness of the cord, we had to physically plug it in each room. The Bissell and Hoover worked in at least 2 rooms without unplugging. Just to vacuum our 1000 sq ft first floor, we had to empty the trash bin thrice. The instructions to open the box were on the top of the box itself, and the installation process is 1-2-3, snap, easy. I'm not a very mechanical person, but I had the vacuum cleaner ready in 5 minutes, with the help of my 7 year old. It's also quieter than my other vacuum cleaners, my 5 year old son fell asleep with the vacuum on. Also, it has good maneuverability, better than my other vacuum cleaners, and its lighter.

READ ON), emptied the bin,  then  vacuumed the living room floor.  Typical job.  Then I re-vacuumed the same area with the Dyson.  I expected a small amount in the bin, but got much more.

Just because some handsome foreigner comes on your television screen to tell you how dramatically engineered this machine is, that is no reason to be swept up (which the product does not do) and sucked into (the vacuum doesn't do that either) his salesmanship.I bought the DC 25 in January, 2009.  By March, 2009, I was ready to have the blasted thing carted away from my home by the garbage men.  The only thing that kept it from the dump was that my college-age son had no vacuum at all and appreciated a machine that would at least pick up his roommate's sandwich scraps.My housekeeper was the first to let me know what a cheap piece of machinery this was.  She liked the way it crept around corners, but she did not like its LACK OF SUCTION.  She said she had to go over spaces on the floor several more time than she had to with my Hoover that she used previously on her visits.  I vacuumed the carpet twice, perhaps four times, between her twice monthly visits.  With the Dyson, she noticed a remarkable lack of care.One thing I noticed was the lack of ability to 'fluff' my carpet back up.  My Hoover used to make my carpets look all new and fresh.  The Dyson keeps my carpet looking beat down and dirty.  Especially since I have pets, this is an important thing for me.  I do not want to feel like I need to replace my carpeting before it is time to do so.  My carpeting has a 15 year limited warranty. It has barely been nine years, and since I have been using the Dyson for the last 9 months, it looks terribly worse.  Also, I find the fact that it does not have 'headlights' a discouraging point.  I have to turn every lamp and light on in every room to see what I am doing while I vacuum with the Dyson. They are cheap in this matter.I know this review is getting very long, but there is one more important factor I must share with you.I have a home carpet cleaner.  It is also a Hoover product.  I try to clean each carpeted room on a regular basis.  Since I have purchased the Dyson, I find that my carpet cleaner is filled with much more dog hair and soot than it used to have.  This tells me the Dyson vacuum is not picking up the dirt it claims to.Don't waste your money.  Go back to what you trust for half the price."

This one seems to be made for me.I had recently had new carpets installed, and my old vaccum was not up to the task. The rugs kept shedding and shedding because the vacuum just wasn't picking up the excess yarn.The first time I used my Dyson DC25 Animal, I had to empty the canister literally every room (and I had vacuumed using an inexpensive Hoover vacuum about three days earlier). There were entire cats in that canister. It is so oddly satisfying SEEING the junk in your carpet in a clear canister rather than having it all hidden away in a bag, where one can only wonder what disgustingness might have lurked.So, yeah, it took care of the cat hair and the shedding carpet. And it's lightweight and very manueverable: the ball means that you can turn it any which way you want while you're pushing this thing around. It's a very neat feature.Then comes the coolest part for me: it's certified asthma-friendly by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. I'm lucky enough to be blessed with both asthma and allergies, and vacuuming has been a particular nightmare this allergy season. It has always seemed that my vacuums kicked up more stuff than they took care of. Not so with the Dyson, which has a lifetime HEPA filer that traps allergens.The wand attachment is built right into the handle-- you just open a cap on top and the wand extends out from there. Very simple.There are no bags to worry about, and it's easy to empty and put back together. The handle is ergonomic, and there's no need to change settings when switching from bare floors to carpet. The machine just knows.Also, it's freakin' purple.There are three details I'd love to see improved: 1. a larger canister, 2. a little more room to maneuver the wand-- it's kind of awkward as is, and 3. a retractable cord. All corded things in life should have retractable cords. Cords are very cordy.Even soulmates, however, are not expected to be perfect. My love for my Dyson is unconditional and everlasting.

In the recent past, a number of Hoover Wind Tunnels, in part due to the rave reviews on Consumer Reports and I liked their embedded dust finder. Consumers was never very hot on Dyson, but recently I found that Consumer Reports has some serious problems with Vacuum reviews and they are flat out wrong about Dyson. Anyway, after 4 years, my last Hoover bite the dust, I was tired of spending $100 every few years getting it repaired and decided that I would not follow their advise but rather come here to Amazon and see what real users say about various products. First of all, the Dyson reviews as anyone can see are stellar. Next, reading about Hoover Wind Tunnels as well, it seems my experience with them matched others; great the first year, then down hill from there on with lots of repairs. Still, $550 for a Vac, that's crazy. Or is it? Well with a 5 warranty, great reviews and some long saved Amazon points from my credit card use, I decided to go with the DC25 Animal. I only wish I had purchased sooner. As others have said, the out of box experience was excellent. Easy to setup. No masses of non recyclable Styrofoam. A nice looking manual with an actual registration card where one can find the serial number. Great web site. So far, so good.First 20 minutes of trying it out, I was in love. Didn't find the ball difficult to get the hang of, just the opposite. Love the ability to turn the beater brush on and off from the handle, unlike the Hoover that was down by the floor and difficult to engage due to the cheap plastic. The DC25 is very light, not noisy. But the amazing part was seeing the basket fill with dog hair and gunk quickly, even though I had used the hoover only a few days before. This Vac sucks like there's no tomorrow! I was shocked by the amount of dirt it picked up. The carpets looked excellent and of course, the DC25 has no problems keeping my tile clean. I like how the unit lifts its back wheels when you engage the unit to vac. So the downside? Well as some have said here, the cord isn't all that long. But heck, even at twice its size, it wouldn't be long enough if the goal is to vac an entire home of a decent size without moving to another outlet. And here are two words to take care of the cord issue: Extension Cord. Sure, it works with a 50 foot extension which can be rolled up with a nice clip and hung over the handle. That problem was solved. I also appreciate that unlike the Hoover, the cord wasn't black but a light gray. My walls are all white and I can't tell you how often the damn Hoover cord would scuff them up with a black marking as you pull it by the walls. I can't say for sure this will not happen with the Dyson but I doubt it (the orange extension cord mentioned above that I used with the Hoover never scuffed the walls).Now onto the small dirt basket. Yes its smaller than other Dysons. But if you find it fills quickly (like I did on the first use), well guess what? You have a dirty home &lt;g>. Just kidding. I did have to empty it half way through the first vacuuming but I suspect as all that old, accumulated dirt my Hoover didn't get is taken care of, this will be less an issue. And emptying is super quick and easy. Its also nice not having to deal with bags. Consumers wasn't all that hot on bagless vac's but after decades of using them, I think I'll be far happier dumping this gung out every time and seeing what I'm picking up as I vacuum. Will save me a ton of money too. Those good Hoover bags are expensive and add up.So my only minor complaint is that while I spent the extra $$ for the Animal attachment (as others have said, that's the only difference other than color between these two Ball units), it doesn't appear to attache to the body of the DC25 like the other tools. That said, it works quite well. We have three dogs, one a Husky that sheds a ton. She likes to get up on leather couch so we keep a pad there. This attachment sucked up the hair beautifully meaning that it will get popped into the washing machine a bit less, saving more money and water. See, you really can justify a $550 Vac if you wan to.Seriously, this really is a lot of money for a vacuum. Unless Dyson has some magical drug embedded into the handle, its pretty clear they can get away with this price because the damn thing is a superb product. The number of reviews here convinced me with only a reservation on the cost but I can honestly say, it was worth every penny, at least so far. If it is reliable unlike my Hoover, I'll be a very happy and life long Dyson customer."

In that time, we've been owners of four of Comsumer Reports' 'best buy' vacuums.  None of them work today.  Upon the last one bellowing smoke, I decided that I'd check out the ratings again.  The Dyson was NOT highly rated, and very expensive.  I decided to go with the Kenmore 'Progressive' bagless.  When I got to Sears to buy my $300 vacuum, it looked and felt so cheap, that I couldn't make myself do it.I walked over to the shelf where the Dyson's were.  Talk about well made!  That was enough to get me to try it.  $467 later (Sears was running a 15% off sale), I'm the proud owner of a DC-25 Animal.This thing is amazing.  Although I'm not the primary 'vacuumer' of the house, I had to try this thing out.  Our bedroom is 15' X 18'.  After vacuuming this room, I had half of a bathroom trash can full of dog hair and dirt that we could never see!

Before purchasing, I read the reviews here, the negative ones especially carefully.Regarding the broken belt reports, those just have to be false. There are no belts in this design; the beater bar is direct-drive and conveniently switchable.The integrated handle and extension wand do seem odd at first, but they really become very easy to use after doing it a time or two. The hose is stiff, but it works and has a good reach.While the collection bin does seem on the small side, we have found that the hair and debris becomes very compressed at the bottom of the bin, so we really don't need to dump the bin any more often than with previous vacuums.And giving the collection bin a couple of shakes before opening the bottom cover usually dislodges the compressed pet hair in our experience. A time or two I've had to release a hair clump by hand, which is no big deal.One reviewer said the attachments fall off of the unit while vacuuming. On my DC25, they attach to their storage and usage positions with a positive 'snap,' and stay snug and secure at all times. If attachments fall off, make sure they are inserted properly so that they snap into place.I agree that the power cord is too short; it takes three outlets to do each level of our two-story house.We have found the hand-held head (with suction-powered beater bars) extremely effective. It is not at all difficult to angle the head properly for maximum suction; I do the carpeted stairs much more rapidly -- and effectively -- with this attachment. Just remember where you put it; there is no onboard storage for this particular tool.Those who have trouble cleaning certain surfaces with the hand-held beater bar attachment should try a variety of techniques. For example, I cleaned a fabric suitcase covered with pet hair by using a side-to-side motion, instead of front-to-back. Our mattress and cloth car seats responded best to a circular motion. Using this attachment requires a little experimentation, which is quick and easy. Just try different patterns until the crud starts coming off.I particularly like the maneuverability of the ball design. It takes a minute or two to get used to, but it becomes very easy to maneuver, and reduces cleaning time.The DC25 Animal picks up a lot more dirt, and somewhat more pet hair, than our previous vacuums. One of these was an Amway Cleartrack, the design of which was, IIRC, 'borrowed' by the corporation from an earlier Dyson design, until Dyson prevailed in a lawsuit. We also used a couple of Hoover models.The DC25's plastic design seems sturdy enough, but only time will tell how durable the unit will be.It requires a little force to return the unit to its upright position, but you can lessen the force required by 'helping' the wheels drop via some gentle pressure with your foot. Even without doing this, though, my wife and I have no difficulty returning the DC25 Animal to the upright position.The unit is very light and is a beautiful piece of engineering. All seals tighten up snugly during operation, and the suction is very strong. The switchable electric beater bar is excllent, and this unit handles transitions from hard surfaces to carpeted surfaces better than any vaccuum I have used over the past 30 years.The unit is well balanced for carrying when using the collection bin handle as recommended.Other bagless vacs we have used have allowed a lot of dust and pet hair to make it through to the pre-motor filter(s). Not so with this unit. After many hours of use, only a small amount of very fine dust has collected on the washable cloth pre-motor filter. Dyson recommends rinsing this and the exhaust filter every few months.This unit also draws a couple less amps during operation than our previous vac, as measured with a Kill-a-Watt.All in all, I would say that the DC25 Animal is worth the price. It is a beautiful machine from both an engineering and aesthetic standpoint, but -- more importantly -- it does an exceptional job of cleaning multiple surfaces."

And that ball is awesome. Very maneuverable.Cons:1. The outlet plug unplugs very easy, it doesn't stay plugged while vacuuming. Minor annoyance.2. The Quick-draw Telescope Reach wand is very unpractical to work with. Maybe it was meant for high to reach places, but not for stairs.

The suction is fantastic. The tools are easy to use, though the hose does take some getting used to, but that's pretty minor. It's a good size and weight, not too heavy. I find it's not exactly quiet, but not roaring like a jet engine either. After vacuuming my entire house with the Dyson, I can walk around in bare feet and I feel absolutely no dirt or debris whatsoever on the floor. It's SUPER clean! It's amazing.Others have said emptying it gives off a puff of dust a bit, and that's true, but it's a trade-off from not having to buy bags! The Dyson seems to compact the dust and sand-like dirt down to the bottom of the canister though, so when you hit the trap door, it falls out first. The cord is another thing people have touched on. Yes, it's shorter than some vacuums, but that's another trade-off to having a lighter machine. Slightly smaller bin size was another one, but that's also not a very big deal to me.I've read all of the reviews on this model on every conceivable website. The negative reviews I found seemed to be mainly from people who 1)unfortunately got the 1 lemon out of a bajillion Dysons, which seems rare. 2)will never be satisfied no matter what. 3)have some sort of bizarre reverse snobbery aversion to Dyson's products. Or 4)have concerns that to me are just personal pet peeves like the cord length, bin size, etc.The overwhelming majority of people who bought the Dyson Ball either love it or like it a whole lot, so take those negative reviews with a grain of salt. I personally love using this vacuum and will no longer slack on the vacuuming!"

Probably why it weighs only 16 lbs, and seems to be pretty tough stuff; I vote light weight rather than cast-iron.  Our Hoover weighed in at 24 lbs and was literally two dozen pounds of junk;  probably would have made a good boat anchor (and do a better job than it ever did as a vacuum).  We'll see how durable it is, but so far, pretty impressed.2)  The cord is 24 feet long; that's about all I'm willing to try and wrap around my arm while vacuuming, and is plenty long for any room in our house.3)  Tremendous vacuum power; emptying canister is not an issue - yes, it fills up with stuff, like all other bagless HEPA canisters I've ever seen or tried.  If you don't want to look at dust, empty dust, or see dust fall out into your wastebasket, get a bag vacuum.  Emptying, by the way, involves pressing two buttons - one to get the canister off the vacuum, and one to dump from the bottom of the canister directly into the trash.  Sweet.4)  More agile than any vacuum we've ever tried - the smaller head really gets into places other vacuums couldn't reach, and the ball is a breeze to maneuver.  Yes, the ball is too large to get under some furniture, but the vacuum head reaches as far as our ex-Hoover, and the detachable hose is really slick to use if you need to get all the way under, say, a bed.A bargain even at the high(er) price.

I have a one-bedroom apartment and after the hoover was finished I turned to the Dyson and it was amazing how much more this vacuum picked up. Now I had to empty the container about 3 times and not because of the size of the container but the amount of pet hair it picked up compared to the old vacuum.As for price of this vacuum, you definitely should carefully weight it in to your decision making.

The ball makes it very easy to manuever around furniture and for a 'vacuumee' who is disabled, this vacuum is the easiest and best worker and very well worth the extra money. We tried it out at Best Buy first for a 'test drive'.  This is definitely a good idea if you aren't sure about spending over $300.00 on a vacuum.

As soon as I got it out of the box and click-click-click put it together, I turned it on and gave it a run around my 8'x10' oriental carpet.  It was shocking how much dirt and hair it picked up that my other vacuum left behind.  I'm uploading a photo of the canister - HALF full of hair/dirt/dust/grossness.  I almost died realizing all that stuff has been there all along.  My rug looks like it's been professionally cleaned.

I think that is because I only have to run over dirt and hair once and it is picked up. That and switching between carpet beater to hard floor to hose/extension tools is very easy. Everything about it is easy; it is easy to move, with handles that are handy, easy to empty, easy to store. And quiet.I bought mine refurbished, because I was afraid of the large price tag but knowing that once I vaccuum my house it is CLEAN, I would be willing to pay the full price. And I have one dog, two long haired cats, plus a parrot and a little bird, so that's a lot of hair and feathers and little bits of chow to clean up. And dust. Lots and lots of dust from them...I can only remember two negative things I read in reviews before I made my purchase. They were rather minor. One was that the cord doesn't retract. Well, no big deal there, I notice to use the hose you have to unwind the cord completely and drop it to the floor. Since I use the hose after I've cleaned the floor, the floor's clean, so no problem. The other was about having trouble picking up larger bits of detritus off the floor. Tip the vaccuum back more so the front comes up and voila, large bit of dogfood vaccuumed away!  Or you could get out your hose attachment... One thing I noticed myself that was a little different is that the increased suction makes it so I have to use a bit more muscle when using the hose attachment. I feel that it's worthwhile considering how much cleaner and faster the vaccuming goes. Besides, it is a lot lighter than my old vaccuum, so my arms aren't all tired from pushing it around the floor.Like I said, I LOVE this vaccuum. And I HATE housework. So I really LOVE this vaccuum."

Like most others, I was really impressed with the vacuum. Its lightweight, easy to clean, and it did a good job at picking hair / dirt up -- at least I thought.  Randomly, the other day a guy came by the house selling a Kirby vacuum and I thought, sure, come on in and demo the thing and I'll pat myself on the back for paying 500 dollars for my vacuum.  Let me tell you, a Kirby put my new Dyson to shame.. absolutely no contest. I was shocked at the amount of dirt / hair the Kirby was picking up (and he had me vacuum the house before he used the Kirby). At first I thought it was a total gimmick but it was impossible because he was using new filter pads every 2 swipes and the amount of dirt coming out of the carpet was embarrassing. Long story short, the Dyson (my vacuum) is pretty looking and it does a decent job but it really isn't that good of a vacuum after comparing it to a Kirby.

I have owned Kirby's, Hoover's, Bissel's Oreck and now after months of nagging from my wife I bought her a Dyson for Christmas. I truly believe these are the most overrated vacuums I have ever seen. First the unit just feels cheap and when releasing the wheels to roll the ball it always feels like its gonna break. My wife insisted on the Dyson because it has a hose built in. The hose is the most ridiculous awkward thing on the vacuum.  When you pull it out the handle comes with it and the straight tube make for a very difficult thing to use due to the rigidity of the design. You can remove the handle and just use the flexible portion but then it is so short you have to pick up the entire unit to reach high places. I believe the ball is in the design since the vacuum is so heavy you need the ball to maneuver it. The cord is so short you have to keep unplugging to get from area to area, even 5 feet would make a huge difference. I still own the two Oreck's I purchased years ago and I think they are far better easy to use vacuum which picks up better. I even did a side by side test with my wife and she finally agreed that I was right. I got a free hand held vacuum when I purchased the Oreck and it does a fantastic job but you have to go get it and use it. I could think of the $500 I could have saved and just keep using my Oreck. It also has a fairly large footprint so when storing the unit we can no longer put in a hall closet we have to put out in the garage.

I just thought that I needed a little time to adjust to it and it would be fine.  The first problem that is a big one for me is the cord is VERY short.  My old Dyson could vacuum my house with the change of one plug, this one was four times just to move from room to room or you will come up short and not be able to finish the room that you are in!  The second problem is the release on the vacuum I almost have to stomp on it to get it to release and then come just short of flipping the vacuum over to get it to catch in the upright position.  The canister on this one is much smaller than my old one and does not move the carpet, as I like to see the lines on the floor, the head of this one just bounces along the top of the carpet.

Since the main point of a vac is to clean your carpets and floors, I must admit that I don't feel it does any better job than my Hoover Windtunnel I had before the Dyson.  I had my Hover for 5 years, and finally got rid of it when it needed a new belt.  I am pleased by my Dyson, but I do have to empty the bin a lot, like three times per room.

I have an average sized home and I like to think I am very 'gentle' with my tools, especially when they cost nearly $600.00. Anyways, the rep informed me that I can take it to a company in my area to have it seviced.  I informed her that I wouldn't be doing that and that I was going to return it where I purchased it.  Something this expensive shouldn't break after 4 uses! I didn't give up on Dyson, yet.  I bought the DC 14 (no ball).

The great thing about this vacuum is after I sweep, it picks up an embarrassing amount of hair, dust, and dirt. However, the really frustrating thing about this vacuum is that I have to sweep first. I figured for the price, it would eliminate that step. This vacuum is so low that it can't even pick up a skittle, not to mention the playground gravel my son brings home from school in his shoes. Also, I guess I was spoiled with a canister, because I like to not have to stop, put the vacuum in upright lock, tug and pull to get the strange wand out, attatch the flat head, just to vacuum under the sofa.

The on button could not be push down at all.  It was not damaged in transport as there was absolutely no damage to the box it was shipped in.  I called Dyson immediately and asked what to do.  I was given the option to ship it back to Amazon or take it to a vacuum repair shop.  I asked the RUDE customer service rep, Latoya,if Dyson would pay for the shipping rate back to Amazon since this was a factory defective vacuum.  She explained that it was not a factory defect and Dyson would not pay for my retun shipping fees.  I asked on what basis she assumed that the defect was not factory related and she stated it wasn't and she knew it wasn't.  Amazing how these companies immediately take no liability for anything nowadays.  I asked to speak to her manager and believe it or not this RUDE man,Ray, also took no responsiblity for the factory defective vacuum.He also would not pay for return shipping charges.With little else to do I took it to an authorized vacuum dealer.  After looking at the packaging and the way the vacuum sat in the box he agreed that it was not broken in transport but a factory defective vacuum.  The customer service department at Dyson was to fax him a repair request but guess what!!!!  They didn't, go figure.  He did get the part faster than he usually gets parts and my vacuum was ready rather quickly.I love my vacuum!!!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I can not believe how well it works.

But before I get to that, here are the things I like:* Great suction in both the vacuum and the wand* Lightweight and maneuverable* No bags or filters to replace, and no belt to break.  As an aside, I've noticed some people complain that the belt has broken.  Either they're not sure what they're talking about, they're reviewing the wrong model, or they're lying.* Decent set of tools* Bin is really easy to empty* 5 year warrantyA few negatives, which are minor:* Bin is somewhat small; we have a fairly small house but still sometimes have to change the container in the middle of cleaning* The wand is a bit awkward to detachAs I said before, I wish I had done a bit more research into Dyson's product line before buying this particular vacuum.The regular Animal, the DC17, has several advantages over the regular Dyson, the DC14: It has a motorized brushbar, it has a mini turbine head attachment, a low reach floor tool attachment, and more 'cyclones.'  I'm not sure how well the extra cyclones work, but Consumer Reports says the DC17 has much better suction than the DC14.  Presumably, the extra cyclones have something to do with that.The DC25 Animal (the vacuum I'm reviewing here) does not have any more 'cyclones' than the regular DC25.  In fact, I believe they both have fewer cyclones than the DC14.  Again, I'm not sure how well the extra cyclones work, but Consumer Reports seems to like them.  Furthermore, both the DC25 Animal and the regular DC25 have a motorized brushbar.  Neither of them have the low floor attachment.In fact, the *only* difference between the DC25 Animal and the regular DC25, as far as I can tell, is the mini turbine attachment.  In case you don't know, this attachment is used to get pet hair off of things like furniture and car seats.  I like it, but other reviewers on Amazon don't seem terribly impressed.If you want a Dyson ball but you don't want the mini turbine attachment, just buy the regular DC25.  If you *do* want a ball and a mini turbine attachment, consider this one -- it's only $50 more than the regular DC25, but the attachment by itself costs more than $50.If you want better suction (at the expense of more weight and less maneuverability), I think I'd recommend the regular Animal."

If stretched a long way, it does not go back onto the vac easily.The plastic dirt bag/container is not easy to empty.  Dog hair and other stuff tend to get stuck, and you might have to reach in to get all the dirt out.

After unboxing it a few hours ago, and giving it a try, amazing amount of dust, pet dander and hairballs came out of a carpet that was, supposedly, freshly vacuumed a couple days ago. yuck!I was expecting the dyson to be incredibly loud, louder than the kenmore I have. What a great surprise it was pretty darn quiet.Putting the vacuum together was easy: snap in the motorized brush base, snap the clear flexible hose to the extensible handle, click, clack put the attachments to the side and done!  I like the fact that you can turn off the motorized brushing action on and off with the push of a button.Cable seems adequate, although it's a bit on the short side. Not to be considered a con, unless you have a house with a single power outlet.One con, is that like most bagless, empyting the canister is kinda messy. Since suction action creates static electricity, it causes plastic to hold on to the cat/pet hairs. What I use to do, is after done vacuuming, wait for a few minutes before emptying the can."

I chose this unit because I have a long haired dog and I expected unique animal related cleaning features (as the name implies). As it turns out, the differences between this unit and the DC25 Yellow are no more than the name, color and a suction driven attachment Dyson calls a mini-turbine head (for $45 more). Except for the color, they're identical machines.I've returned the DC25 and had the DC07 repaired.PROS:*Relatively light and easy to handle.*Brush headUnlike the older Dyson models, the brush head has its own motor and a smaller profile which allows for easier access to more areas and the clutch switch has been replaced with an easier to reach button adjacent to the on/off switch.*Easier maneuverability due to the ball design.CONS:*Undersized collection container We found ourselves emptying the container several times/day*Emptying collection container is a NUISANCE We found that our dog's long hairs got caught up inside the container and that only way to empty the container was to either reach in (no thanks) or use another vacuum. We ended up reaching for another vacuum most of the time.*Cord too short The cord is about long enough for you to vacuum one room. If you have several rooms to clean and you don't mind plugging/unplugging than this wouldn't be an issue for you. It was for us.*Power head switch If you want to turn the roller brush off, for cleaning hardwood floors, for e.g., you can simply press a button next to the on/off switch. This is a nice improvement over the DC07. What I didn't like here is that if the brush head has been turned OFF and you then turn the vacuum OFF, Dyson forces the brush head back ON before turning the vacuum OFF. Dyson probably determined they could save a few pennies with this design but I suspect it will, ultimately, shorten the life of the powered brush head.*Mini-Turbine Head As indicated earlier, the small brush head rotates via the suction coming from the  vacuum. It struck me that the brush rotation didn't provide any significant advantage over using the dust tool attachment. In addition, you're left managing it since Dyson didn't provide a way to attach it to the vacuum.All in all, the key issue I have with this vacuum is the woefully inadequate collection/disposal system. I consider this to be fundamental flaw: it's simply too small and, when dealing with pet hair, necessitates another vacuum to empty it properly. Back to the drawing board."

Sounds easy but consider the puff of dust as you empty it.  Also you have dig the dog hair out of an inner crevice where it packs in...more puff of dust.  Add to that the thing in the middle with holes gets plugged up and that has to be cleaned often also.2. When the directions say not to run over, well just about everything, they're not kidding.  When ran over a very thin paper ribbon and that was enough to break the belt.3. The power and the overall job is really no better then our old Hover.  Accept the Hover was not so hard to clean, had stronger belts and I could throw away the bag resulting in the missing multiple puffs of dust.4. The attachments are very unhandy.

It's as simple as that.One thing, though - even if you're a fairly fanatical vacuumer, prepare to be disgusted with what you pull up the first time that you use the Dyson. I am owned by one Golden Retriever- Sheltie mix who blows coat twice a year, plus two longhaired cats that leave fur trails daily (despite frequent grooming of all three). I purchased my Dyson Animal last month after burning through the fourth belt in as many months on my old vacuum (an Oreck, no slouch in itself).  I did a lot of research and decided that a Dyson that was purpose-built for pet hair had to be worth a try.Well. I had just vacuumed the day before the Dyson arrived, but thought I'd take my new appliance for a spin just the same. I ran the Dyson over the carpet in my previously-vacuumed (and recently professionally-shampooed) living room, and the amount of hair, dust and other assorted debris that the Dyson lifted was genuinely astonishing (AND totally disgusting, when I considered that it had all been lurking in the rug!). I had to empty the waste container four times during that first use, and it is not a small container. I could have knit a whole new dog from the amount of long red hair that the Dyson Animal found.Subsequent uses are now keeping the carpets clean, and the rooms even smell fresher. Added and unexpected bonus: my allergies have substantially declined.I have since used the Dyson on both carpet and oriental rugs, and while it surely and quickly gets the dirt and hair, I have seen no unwanted lifting of fibers from the rugs. One note - when you first fire it up, if it doesn't seem to be picking up as it ought, make sure you find and engage the switch that turns on the rotating brush (you can turn that brush off for doing hard floors or very delicate rugs).  Note that if you're used to really lightweight vacuums, this one will seem heavy. The weight actually is very useful in helping it to grip the carpet, and the ball makes it extremely maneuverable, so in general the weight isn't an issue. It would only be a drawback if you happen to have serious difficulty with lifting and if you also frequently need to go up and down stairs with your vacuum, in which case you may want to consider a lighter model.Setup was easy and took less than 10 minutes. The vacuum is well built and based on Dyson's reputation and bazillions of other reviews, I don't anticipate any problems with its durability. I also appreciate Dyson's use of recyclable cardboard for all interior packing - no styrofoam to clog the landfills.All in all, it's a fantastic vacuum and well worth the money, especially if you have four-legged fuzzies in your home."

We have 2 dogs (german shepherd/husky) and always have dog hair everywhere.  I have thick, off-white carpet in one part of the house and a tight, short berber in other areas.I am IN LOVE with my Dyson and wouldn't trade it for the world.  I ordered it from Amazon several weeks ago (Feb 2009) and have been vacuuming frequently.  My husband, myself and several others all feel that our carpet looks VERY clean.  I'm amazed at how much dog hair, dirt and junk it is picking up.I will say that the canister gets filled up quickly due to all the dog hair in our home, so to vacuum the entire house (2000 square feet) I have to empty it about 6 times.  But - that would never make me not buy this.  I love to see all the yuck that has been picked up off the carpet and it's very easy to empty the canister and go back to vacuuming.  The canister does have lots of dirt clinging on the inside, but I just use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe it down on the inside now and then.I debated over the animal vs. non-animal - think the major differences I found were color (non animal is yellow/animal is purple) and the animal one comes with an extra attachment that has come in handy for vacuuming furniture, steps and my car.I also LOVE the hose on this vacuum.  I can easily vacuum all the steps and even the corners of the ceiling (to get at cobwebs) with ease.  No more balancing the vacuum on one step while I try to vacuum the other steps.  Just leave it at the bottom of the steps and the hose can reach them all!"

The positives I can list:  nice style, fairly quiet, the ball was kind of neat to manuever it around, although a little sloppy.  The dirt cup comes off of the vacuum without making a mess, which is nice.  The cons: This has the worst suction I've ever seen.  It barely lifted the pile of the carpet, left quite a bit of dog hair behind. The carpet looked smashed down like I took a wide toothed rake to it. It 'never loses suction' because it didn't have any to begin with.  When emptying the dirt cup, I had to shake the dickens out of it to get the dog hair to fall out... which it didn't, so I had to try to stick my hand up there to get it out (my hand didn't fit, the cup is obstructed by the filter in the middle) so the hair stayed in there until I ran it again for it to swirl back down.  Closing the bottom of the cup is messy because there is dust all over it from shaking it out, which then puts dirt onto your vacuum. The pet hair attachment didn't work the greatest but it was ok. The cord is way too short for a vacuum in this price range.  I had a Hoover Wind Tunnel bagged vacuum before this, and the suction and cleaning was unbelievable.  I figured after replacing too many belts and the switch, I'd get something that might last longer.  I don't know about the longevity of Dyson vacs, but I do know that the one I had was terrible.  I wouldn't recommend.  I purchased a $40 dirt devil featherlite in the meantime... it picked up every single dog hair.  I'll gladly save $500 to have a clean floor!"

One was bagged and the other was bagless.  They were both CRAP!  I would have to take part the vacuum and unclog it just to get moderate suction power.  In the end all i was left with was carpeting that looked clean at first glance...simply because of the vacuum track marks.  But when i would closely inspect the carpet, it was nasty.  Still covered in dog hair and dust!  I wasn't able to vacuum our dog's hair to save my life and it was starting to stress me out.  I gave in and started to research online for a new QUALITY vacuum. After hours of online research it came down to two choices and they were both Dysons.  I had seen the commercials, knew people that owned them, and was always skeptical about paying so much money for a vacuum cleaner but I couldn't ignore the reviews from both average Joe's and online Consumer Reports.It was either the DC17 Animal or the DC25 Animal.In the end, I went with the DC25 Animal because of it's smaller profile and ease of use.  I am able to vacuum everywhere in the apartment without having to move lots of things around.  The ball simply was icing on the cake.  I was willing to give up the smaller collection bin for the low profile and 'ball.'  I was so totally right!!!  Had i purchased the DC17, I would have had some problems getting under and around things in my apartment.If you live in an apartment, if you own a dog/cat, if you HATE DUST, if you currently own a POS vacuum and are reading these reviews, trying to figure out if you are gonna cave in and buy a Dyson....DO IT NOW!!!  BUY THE DYSON DC25 ANIMAL!!!!  You will be glad you did and you won't ever mind cleaning your apartment EVER AGAIN!!! It does it all!!!PROS:-Cleans the carpet like a vacuum should!!!-I got four words for you dog lovers...'NO MORE PET HAIR!!!'-Low profile let you vacuum under and around without other attachments.-The attachments let you clean everything from ceiling fans to sofas!!!-Ball; the ball makes it fun to vacuum!!!-The Dyson name...you know it will SUCK the best!!!Cons:-Smaller dust bin than other models.  You will have to empty it 3-4 times when vacuuming a, really dirty, 3 bedroom apartment.*****FIVE STARS*****Even with the smaller dust bin, the Dyson DC25 Animal lives up to the hype.

The first time we used it (having just vacuumed with our old vacuum a couple of days earlier) - we had to empty the canister three times.I do have some minor gripes.  It wasn't something I noticed prior to purchase - but unlike a lot of vacuums - the DC25 does NOT have a light on the front.  It would definitely be useful in corners / under hard to move furniture.  The hose attachments provided in the box are good - but none worked amazingly well on the stairs.  The brush attachment wasn't stiff enough, and the other just didn't pickup all the animal hair - so I'm about to purchase the $20 stiff brush to see how that works.  Lastly, the power cord could be a little longer.As per another review, the hose design did take a minute to get used to - but is very space saving and to my surprise was long enough to do our stair case without dragging the vacuum half way up the stairs.I'm still rating this vacuum as five stars because it does an excellent job of cleaning carpet, is easy to manoeuvre, and is a lot lighter and less noisy than my old vacuum."

I did a bunch of online research and narrowed it down to this one, the DC17 and the Kenmore Progressive. I chose the DC25 because it's lighter than the DC17 and it has the re-cleanable filters whereas the Kenmore you have to replace. Also the ball maneuverability is nice to have, and come on, it just looks cool. This DC25 works great. I've only used it once, but it's done a better job than me on my knees with my old vacuum. Gonna be a huge time saver, assuming it lasts and performance doesn't degrade over time. We shall see.I only gave it 4 stars because I believe use of the hose extension is kind of a pain. My old vacuum I could just pull the hose out and start sucking. This one you have to flip a cap, extend a pole, press a button and do a jiggling pulling motion to pull the hose out.

I was never satisfied, mostly because they where too heavy to handle, or the animal hair was blown about, rather than sucked up. I do have a canister vacuum that I have had for years, but I wanted a satisfactory upright that was light and easy to handle. I have a cat and a dog, and there is lots of shedding hair, all the time. Our house is mostly hard floors, stairs, and one large rug in the living room. When I saw the DC25 Animal, I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job. It has lived up to my wildest dreams, it is wonderfully easy to handle, so easy to maneuver, the 16 lbs make such a difference compared to those very heavy machines I had before, I had no problem carrying it upstairs. I love that with this vacuum I don't need to select different heights, it goes from floor to carpet to floor. I was even able to clean the dogs bed without the wand attachment. Speaking of the wand/handle attachment you simply flip open the top cap, pull up on the wand, and it disconnects from the vacuum and suction diverts to the wand. It took a little getting use to, the hose is a little stiff and took a while before I was comfortable cleaning the stairs. Most important, THIS VACUUM SUCKS, but in a good way!!Assembly was fairly easy, suppose to be 3 snaps with no tools. But I had a heck of a time getting it out of the box, and being not mechanically inclined I would have liked better instructions.I have never reviewed a product before, but this vacuum cleaner has me so excited that I had to share it with someone. I really love this machine!"
"986","XX","B001EFMD8W","5.0","December 8, 2008","A31CNA49GJSP4S","Great vacuum","Our old vacuum was overheating so much that it takes me two cooldown session to even vacuum half my apartment, even after opening it up and cleaning it.  So after eyeing this one for a month or two, I finally decided to buy this one instead of spending money on a cheaper vacuum that will probably break in a year or two.  This vacuum comes with a 5 year warranty, so even if it costs 3 times as much as many vacuums, I expect it to last at least as long as 3 of those vacuums, especially since the filter is washable and never needs replacing.Once I opened the box, which was even well-designed, assembly was easy.  Everything snaps into place without much force, and it was working a few minutes out of the box.I then tried it out.  The vacuum is fairly light, and extremely easy to maneuver.  Tt picked up so much dust, hair, and dander that my previous vacuum left behind that I had to empty the canister twice.  It even cleared up most of the dust which was floating in the air before.  The roller is extremely easy to remove when you need to clean it.  I took a quarter to the giant plastic screw and it popped right out, a feature I wish I had on my previous vacuums.Emptying the dust canister was easy as well, since it pops right out and has a button to release the bottom.  However, I find that it opens too fast so it disturbs the fine dust laying on the bottom of the canister and makes some of it airborn.  And a few times, I've had to reach in to get the dust out because it doesn't all fall into the trash bin when it clumps up, but both downsides are still minimal compared to my other canister vacuum, where I had to turn over the entire canister every time.The telescopic wand is very very handy and snaps in and out easily.  The reach on the wand is also very long, and can just about reach the top of my steps with the vacuum on the bottom of the stairs.While the vacuum itself is great, I'm not as fond of the turbine head attachment in the DC25 Animal version.  I tried it on the suitcase my cat was sleeping on, and it took several runs through the same spot to clean her hair off, which isn't much different from non-turbine brushes.  On the microfiber futon we have, it worked very well, however.  I also tried it on the stairs, but it doesn't seem to clean very well unless the angle was perfect, and when combined with the telescopic wand, is a pretty steep angle, causing me to have to lift it up higher than is comfortable.  It'd probably be fine if I was 6' tall, but I'm not.  If the turbine head attachment had an auto-adjusting angle, I would have no complaints at all about it.All in all, the DC25 part of the vacuum is just about flawless, and got me very excited about using it, but the turbine head attachment found in this Animal version is not quite as perfect.  The DC25 is definately worth every penny, just not as enthusiastic about the Animal part."

You will want them, trust me but they will cost you.  The hard floor tools, the hose attachment and the dusting tools and so on.2) If you don't have the hose extension and you are trying to dust high places, wear foot protection and be prepared for an arm workout.  That hose wants to go back to the vacuum like crazy and you will have to use muscle to make it do what you want.  The vacuum will then come after you and your feet.On the plus side the groom tool is really good as long as your dog is fine with the noise of the vacuum.  I have an Australian Shepherd with long bushy hair and it really helps cut down on how much he sheds.

The Dyson DC25 Animal Ball does exactly what you want a vacuum to do......suck.  This cleaner has it all; the latest technology, an extended hose for cleaning with attachments, and is quiter than our old vacuum.  My wife researched several brands and styles, and read many reviews.  And this is the one.  It has everything that you'll want in an upright vacuum, and is great on pet hair.  There is nothing like it."

It lasted just under two years before it died.  Fed up with vacuum's that don't seem to last very long, i opted for the Dyson DC 25 Animal.  Holy Smokes!  Hello!!!!!  Where have you been hiding all these years?  I'm in love with my vacuum.  Did i just say that?  Anyway, it's been really nice and powerful.  What I'm pulling out of my carpet is down right gross, but very nice to see that it's coming up.  My initial reaction is really positive. Easy to use and easy to maneuver  with the 'Ball Technology'.  My wife really has also been really impressed.  This one has a five year warranty, so I'm crossing my fingers that it will last.Update!  So, after some more additional research on vacuum cleaners, i did an about face.  I opted to try the Hoover T-series Windtunnel  vacuum.  In my head to head with the more than 4 times as expensive Dyson, here is what i've learned.  Both do an excellent job of cleaning, both do an excellent job of in terms of functionality. Both seem to pick up a ton of dirt.  The Hoover also offers a couple of innovation that the Dyson doesn't. The Hoover has an auto cord rewind.  That's a major plus if it can hold up over time.  The hoover also has a toe taping feature that lets you turn off the rollers while sweeping a hardwood floor. It actually sucks it up instead of flipping it all over the floor. And last of all, it was the price.  I can buy 5 Hoover vacuums for the price of one Dyson.  If my hoover breaks down, i can simply toss it and get another one."

I'm glad there is a 5 year warranty on this but I feel when you pay this much for a vacuum i shouldn't have had this much trouble with it.

I vacuumed my whole house before I took it back and then vacuumed it again with my 8 year old Bissell. The Bissell won. I also noticed the ball collected lots of dust, which it's also not supposed to do. When I spoke to Dyson, they also agreed it was not supposed to do that and suggested I exchange the unit.

It is simply the best vacuum we have ever owned.  It is an upright vacuum with more cleaning power than our other sweepers put together.  We have a sweeper on each floor of the house and none compare to this one.  It is extremely light and the roller ball makes is easy to sweep in tough areas.  For lack of a better word, it is 'agile' and easy to move around.  We don't have a pet but we purchased it for the extra cleaning power and the HEPA features.Sweep your floors three times with your old sweeper and then use this one on the same carpet.  I guarantee you that you will pick up a full container of dust, dirt and old loose carpet fibers that the old vacuum would not even pick up.  It has a HEPA filter and is certified asthma friendly and has a hygienic dust bin.  It doesn't take cleaner bags and is fairly easy to clean.  It has a set of tools on the vacuum and a telescoping wand to reach the hard spots.  It comes with a 5 year warranty and it is the best sweeper you can get.One down side is a question that my wife and I discuss, 'Does anyone who designs household appliances ever use them?'  If they did they would make the hose on the telescoping wand 12 to 18 inches longer.  It is hard to reach the high spots and when the vacuum is running the suction is so strong it wants to collapse the extension hose.  I know there is a limit but the extra length would have made it perfect to get to stair cases, ceiling fans and the tops of high windows."

Also the hose for the extendable wand tends to want to stay coiled up like it is when is it collapsed but that could be because I haven't used it much and it is still stiff and new.

Other vacs seem heavy when operating.I've used Hoovers growing up, one was the old school Type A bag, the other was a bagless with a cleanable filter. I was like, eh, they are vacuums, they are all the same.I worked at Best Buy in college and I was told the Dyson was the best. Well, this last weekend I needed a new vacuum because my Hoover Type A vacuum kinda pushed around dust while going over carpet. I wanted something to last a long time and the best quality, so I walked into a Dyson store.I spent about an hour test driving all the vaccums. The canister vac is harder to move with a lot of parts everywhere making little sense (although I did enjoy the automatic power cord!), the models above the DC25 are larger made for a big house, much too heavy for the 2 bedroom condo I'm at. I thought the DC25 handled the best, mostly when you need to angle back and forth. I took apart the dust carrier with ease, the filters are easy to find. There's a little work to manually wind the cord. And there's a little work to operate the extension arm for ceiling corners. But those were acceptable if the price for the machine was right.We get down to price, I'm already worried at this price point because this is 2-3 times the amount of a regular vac. I ended up buying the DC24, which saved me $50 because the only difference I can see is an additional brush extension piece made for animals. And it's an orange vac instead of a purple one. I really wanted purple but let's see if it works at home.Vacuumed a 12 by 12 bedroom. After one vac, it was already worth the price paid. Massive power with a light swingweight. The results showed up in the dust canister, the vac simply did the job better than anything I've ever seen. Simply stunning. Also takes up less space to store. WOW!"

Finally I figured it out and the vacuum just started to do its job: suck everything in. We did not notice there were so much dust on the floor and the vacuum checked it for us. It sucked everything in.Thank you Dyson and the best of all it came with a 5-yr warranty."

Guess you can tell that I like my new Dyson a lot. The one area where they could do better is on their attachments. A bunch came in the box with the vacuum. Some you can pretty much tell what the use is but some, it's hard to tell. For example; there is a grooming tool that comes with the animal clean up kit. It doesn't look the pet grooming tool that I can see on line ... so how do you use it? Is it also a pet grooming tool? Don't know. I emailed Dyson a day after delivery when I registered my vacuum on line. Four days later I got a response telling me to call a number for customer service and they will help.

It's easy to move around, and it's fairly easy to carry up the stairs.  I don't bother sweeping my wood floor anymore, since the Dyson does a better job anyway.  When my wife's hair got wound around the brush roll on my old vacuum, it was a long process to dismantle the bottom of the machine, remove the belt, pull the roller off, and clean out the hair.  With the Dyson, the entire motor head comes off, and the brush roll can be easily removed for cleaning.  Much better.Bad: The hose is too short/tight and you feel like you're dragging the entire machine around when using it.  The setup instructions are not very clear (and I've assembled many appliances over the years).  The collection bin is not big enough, and the machine's effectiveness means you'll be emptying out the bin many times.Overall, I'm really glad I bought this.

Exactly as expected and even better, in fact.  BUT.. the instructions for putting the vaccum cleaner together are HORRIBLE.  No words - all graphics - and the graphics are rather confusing. The 'quick' instructions attached to the handle piece neglect to tell you to push the wand down into the hose.  PUSH THE WAND INTO THE HOSE.... even the instructions online on the Dyson website are so generalized they fail to include this important detail.  I am not stupid - I've got two degrees, darnit - and I've put lots of other things together with fewer instructions.  Not one of the images shows the wand inside the hose, but they all show you pushing the handle onto the wand and then the wand onto the unit.  The YouTube instructions also fail to show this part, and again, do not cover this exact model of the vaccum.  Its rather easy once you know this detail... and then removing the wand from inside the hose is also quite easy.  The attachments include a small beater for cleaning carpeted stairs - yippee!Now to the most important part:  the vaccuming.  I have six cats and a house full of carpeting, plus we use a woodstove in our carpeted family room.  I just vaccumed - it pulled out hair, dust, ashes and dirt from my carpet which had just been vaccumed yesterday with my old vac (Hoover Upright).  Empyting the canister is easy - in fact, I was expecting to empty it the 'old' way and ended up dumping all the stuff on my feet.  Duh...  you empty it over the garbage can with one hand by flicking a switch, unlike the 'old' vac canister which had to be taken apart and then turned over to empty.  Right away I was pleased by this.  I was able to vac under and around furniture that I was unable to vac around and beneath before; so its rather nice to not have to stop what I'm doing to move the coffee table, for instance, then vac, then return it.  Now I just vac.  This is too easy!I bought mine through Kohl's because I had a discount and I earned Kohl's cash ($15 for every $50 spent), which I was able to combine with other discounts later for holiday shopping.  In all, I ended up paying about $480 for this model without waiting for delivery or fighting shoppers for the few vacs on sale at other retail chains on Black Friday."

Neither is really appropriate.To the people who say it's cheap and worthless, i have to ask- what did you expect for a $100 vacuum? If you want a super great indestructible machine, why didn't you buy a Dyson or an Oreck, duh? You bought this Dirt Devil for the same reason I did, because it says it does great things for a very low price. And for the most part, it does. Granted, I haven't had any of the problems that some have written about like the thing overheating and shutting down or just plain not working anymore. These things might happen and then I will be plenty mad; but I have mostly wood floors with just a couple of deep pile area rugs, and I recommend it for people who have a similar situation. I never have the thing turned on for much more than 5 minutes at a time. And it does a superb job of sucking up cat hair and grime from those rugs. Also love the electrostatic pet brush attachment. I used to rely on an old canister vacuum and a dust buster and I can't believe how much dirt this thing picks up so quickly. Kinda grosses me out seeing how much I hadn't been getting up before.Reviewers who complain that the vacuum shoots out debris from behind: they are absolutely right.This vacuum has what is supposed to be a dial that adjusts the height for deep pile to bare floor. However, after examination it didn't take long to realize that the dial does absolutely nothing. The wheeled foot that is supposed to change the distance to the floor doesn't even come in contact with the adjustment piece. It's always at the deep pile height. This is a really stupid design flaw and I can't figure out how to correct it because the shape of the foot is designed to block contact with the adjuster. Because it's so far from the bare floor, debris can shoot out from underneath.I would like to complain about it but it seems, from the other negative reviews, that it's almost impossible to get the company to pay attention. However, the attachments have enough sucking strength that debris can be easily picked up from bare floors with them.Another problem i had was getting a replacement belt.Not being used to an upright, I didn't realize that the base keeps sucking even when the attachment hose is in use. I don't know if this is typical of uprights. Because of this I accidentally ran over a sock while I was vacuuming furniture, and it got stuck, which caused the belt to break.I did a lot of research to try to figure out what the replacement needed to be. It's listed as Style 23 on the vacuum, which didn't correspond with the style (20)indicated on the broken belt, on Amazon they didn't even OFFER one, and the Dirt Devil website had a parts link that offered two other completely different choices, one of which was Hoover. Of course, of the many many different sizes of belts that Dirt Devil sells thru retailers, none of them were the right one in any of the stores I visited. I wrote to the company and they gave me the same stupid link to the two choices that were not either belts style 23 or 20. I had to go to a local vacuum retailer, who looked up the part online and figured out which Hoover belt it corresponded to (I didn't know Dirt Devil is a Hoover product line) bless him, I would never have figured it out without his expertise-- and his complete supply of vacuum parts. I'm sure he was wondering why I would buy a piece of junk instead of one of his very nice $600 machines with unbreakable metal components. I certainly would, if I could afford it; but I can't. So, at least for a couple of years (fingers crossed) I will get by with my adequate Dirt Devil.I don't expect it to be perfect. I expect better customer service and parts availability (and they could improve the included manual, as far as description of parts and repairs) but the machine itself is totally fine for a $100 vacuum.You absolutely get what you pay for.UPDATE:  I forgot to mention that I was confused by other reviews that said this thing was light and practically moves itself. This vacuum is pretty heavy and awkward-- and I'm not a weakling. It's a hassle to drag it upstairs, and moving it around to use the wand tools is a workout. Even so--- great suction, both on the rug and with the tools. If you have any mobility challenges I wouldn't recommend it, but I've used other more expensive uprights that were just as cumbersome.... and it's definitely better than lightweight low suction machines."

It's not my favorite way to spend that much money but the sucking power of the Dyson didn't disappoint and it cleaned all of the carpets and got the pet hair off without having to constantly make multiple passes with it. The only problems with the Dyson are it costs a lot and every once in a while there's this horrible gear crunching noise which the instructions say is part of a belt safety mechanism to protect the belt from getting broken. Only problem is it happens every time we use it.So when I had the opportunity to try this vacuum out I jumped. And let me tell you this thing is just as good as the Dyson.Cons: (-1 star)-The cord on this is not as long as the Dyson, I found I had to unplug and re-plug it twice to get my entire living room carpet cleaned. With the Dyson it's a long cord so I didn't have to ever do this.-Emptying the clear bin on the Dyson is as simple as a button on top and the spring loaded so it pops open, on the Dirt Devil it isn't difficult but it's not as easy. But for a savings of $300 I'm not really complaining that much.-Vacuum hose has to be connected to a plug on the base when used as an upright, in my initial tests the hose popped off multiple times. Finally after getting it pushed in with some force it stayed. It could just be it's new and the fit wasn't right yet but I didn't expect this type of problem to happen.Pros: (+4 stars)-head light, I know who would have thought? My Dyson doesn't have any lights on it, this one does and oddly I must admit that extra light does help.-High suction, easily picked up the pet hair and since my wife decorated the house for fall there were little decorative berry things that fell on the floor that were trash and it sucked those up too on the first pass.-Filters, I like that this has washable filters.-Assembly couldn't be easier. Literally unscrew 2 screws on the upright part (obvious which ones), take the top part of the handle and put it where the screws were at and put the screws back. That's it!Overall I really liked this vacuum. It easily matched the power of the Dyson I have and frankly at the low cost I was surprised at how effective this vacuum is. Great for pet owners, high power and easy to clean.Good job to Dirt Devil on this one."

Right  now all three are shedding a lot right  now, so there is a lot of pet hair on the floor, rugs, carpet, and  furniture. I vacuum my house 5-7 days a week (and the off days I let the iRobot clean up) depending what I have going on. I used the Dirt Devil Power Reach Multi Cyclonic Pet vacuum and it sucked up (in one pass) the random kitty litter that somehow ends up in practically every room of the house- where my previous vacuums would just blow it around and maybe pick up half after a couple passes. Also, picked up a lot of pet hair, I  could not believe how much dirt, hair,ect that was in the canister. I vacuumed the rooms yesterday afternoon and I would never have realized how much was actually left behind!This vacuum has powerful suction and sucks up everything in its way!I absolutely love the Turbo Tool, that worked great on my sofa, loveseat and chairs, cleaned up the pet hair and the furniture does not have a layer of pet hair!The cord is fairly long, but I would prefer a little longer cord and a longer hose possibly (not much longer) for using the attachments.This is going to be replacing my Bissel vacuum!"

"1045","XX","B003OA77MC","5.0","January 4, 2011","AODGRNBXXLFKZ","awesomeeeeee","Let me just say that this vacuum is absolutely amazing! My husband picked it out online sunday night for me and it got delivered today as I was on my way out the door and as soon as I got back home I ripped that baby open. Easy assembly, only two screws for the handle. Plugged her in and fired her up. Now I vacuumed yesterday with the only vacuum I had left (Hoover circa 1965 that had belonged to my grandmother), as I had blown up a $150 Bissell a few months back. The sad thing is, the antique Hoover picks up probably a tad bit more then the 5 year old Bissell. I knew that this new Dirt Devil would be picking up some of what the Hoover had left behind, but I was truly amazed. I filled up the canister with just my living room, which is 12x17. I have two short haired dogs, so I frequently use the Carpet Fresh that helps to release dog hair from carpet. The canister had about 1.5 inches of Carpet Fresh in it, and then there was about a 4 inch pile of dog hair all the way around. I just vacuumed yesterday, mind you. I was so excited, I felt like a 7 year old on Christmas morning. I was also truly disgusted at how much the old vacuums had left behind. My carpet was actually about 3 shades brighter then it was this morning, and it was night time! I can not believe the suction that this vacuum has, and it is fairly quiet for a 12 amp motor. With only a budget of around $100, I was not expecting much, but I feel like I bought one worth a $1000. It seems sturdier then most vacuums, even ones that cost 5 times as much. I sold large and small appliances at a major chain store before for two years, and this tops anything we had on the shelf. It comes with all of the attachments, has a cord long enough for two rooms, and switches carpet height easily. There is a light on the front, the filters are easily accessed (and washable!), and it even seems to be self propelled (don't know if that is listed as a feature). The only thing that I would have liked more was a longer hose, but the way it is will work. Small thing to live with, considering how wonderful the rest is. It cleaned my couches beautifully. At one point I even lost the non-powered attachment in between the cushions because there was so much suction! I could not recommmend a better vacuum. My mom is going to be jealous; she bought a $200 Hoover last year for pet hair, and it doesn't perform half as well as this $100 Dirt Devil!"

I am so amazed at how well this vaccuum does its job!  I thought you had to pay a lot of money to get a good vaccuum, you know, one that really works, so I went and bought a Dyson DC-25 Animal to see what it could do.  I don't own any pets, but I thought that a vaccuum designed to pick up even all the pet hair in a house would be the best, and I'd heard all the hype about Dyson and how it's supposed to be so great.  Then I brought it home, tried it out and thought, 'really?  this is supposed to be worth slmost $600?'  I could not justify all that money for something that seemed to work no better than all the others I'd had before, so I took it back, disappointed.  I decided to buy this dirt devil instead for less than a fifth the price based off reviews here, and man am I glad I did!!  I tried it out as soon as it arrived and it sucked up stuff even the Dyson had missed - I mean a lot of stuff!  This vaccuum is awesome.  Even better than the Dyson and so much cheaper, it's a no-brainer.  Plus it's still bagless, has a hepa filter, and all the attachments you need.  The only thing I don't like is one of the attachments always seems to fall off when I'm really getting into it going under the table or around other furniture, but I can totally live with that.  Buy this thing and be happy!!  Or get the Dyson so you can tell all your friends what a dum-dum you are for spending so much money on a so-so vaccuum."

First the good - it sucks really good, the cord is the right lenght, the price was good and no shipping added. It is also easy to empty and to clean inside.  But, when I started using it I noticed that it was quite noisy comparing to others. When using the side hose the main part of the vacuum wibbles and is ready to fall constantly, because the hose is short and stiff and it is hard to reach with it anywhere without tipping the rest of it over.  But the kicker is that the darn thing shuts itself off whenever it pleases and then the troubleshooting guide tells you to wait a half an hour to be able to use it again. What's up with that? Now the thing dictates when it will start or not? I have never seen it or experienced it with other vacuums I was using before.  So if you have a light cleaning for a short period of time then you should be happy with it. If you have a heavy duty tasks for the vacuum try something different. This one is like a moody princess and does not want to work very hard. At least not in my house mind you."

We broke it down as much as possible to see if there was maybe something clogging the hose.  Absolutely nothing there. We figured the seal around the canister where it opens just wasnt sealing completely. From constantly emptying it to make sure it wasn't getting too full, the hinge to the canister weakened and eventually broke off on one side. The kicker? The hose still gets plenty of suction, it's the only part of the vacuum that is still useable.  I won't ever buy a Dirt Devil again.

It vacuums well and is relatively quiet -  two things that are really the most important.  The price is a good value.The hose is a little short and the wire could use another couple of feet, but it's adequate.  Switching the hose into and out of the base of the unit eventually loosens the join so you will need to find a way to keep it from constantly falling out which is an annoyance.The switch is in an awkward spot and for someone with a big foot, boots, or deep shoe, it will be a problem to squeeze your foot into the space to turn it on.I'm mostly happy with this purchase and will update this review when we determine how long it lasts."

So you can reach most locations.- Canister is easy to remove and re-install.- Canister is easy to open and debris is easy to dump out.- Primary filter is fairly easy to clean.- HEPA filter seems to function well.  There is no 'vacuum' smell when operating.- Unit is fairly light and easy to maneuver.- Electrical cord stowing is the basic wrap around two arms.  Contains the cord well and does not slip off until arm is rotated.  Has plenty of room for the cord to wrap.- Other than the overheating/shutoff problem (see Cons below), the product seems fairly well and ruggedly designed for its price.Cons:- Thermodynamically under-engineered.  Motor overheats and the thermal shutoff switches shut off the vacuum consistently at between 7 to 8 minutes.  Have to allow to cool for 15 to 20 minutes before unit will operate again.  Has been doing this since Day 1.  Cleaning the primary filter does not help.  Even does this with cleaned and thoroughly dried primary filter and with the HEPA filter removed.  Noticed that other reviews regarding this vacuum are complaining about the same problem.  Taking the head apart and getting into, found that the engineers designed in the motor without much thought of conducting the heat off of it - no heat sinks.  The motor is just surrounded by plastic mounts.  So the heat is isolated and builds up until the thermal shutoff switches shut the power off to the motor.  I think the engineers realized this problem too late into the design process.  Fixing the problem would have involved a whole backup and re-design and would have probably taken too much money.  So instead the manufacturer places a big sticker on the back of the vacuum stating 'Do not return to store.  Contact us for questions'.  Will give a summary of how this goes when we call them, to see if they are going to give us the run-around.- Electrical cord is only 22 feet long and requires switching to different electrical outlets a little more often than desired.- Forward light is really dim and fairly useless.  Not a big deal for most uses.Summary:If it wasn't for the unit overheating and shutting off so quickly, this vacuum would be a great value.  But because the overheating problem renders the unit utterly useless I'm giving it a rating of 1 out of 5.I'll let you know how the customer service goes, and if a replacement vacuum solves the problem (if that even happens)."

Considering the price this product is unsurpasssed.  Features are nice, and all atachments and canister are easy to use.  I have nothad it long enough to see determine the durabilty, but in event it did go out in a couple of yeers, I would turn around and buy another. The only  small downfall was the short power cord."

It replaced a Bissel that worked pretty well, but disintegrated after a couple of years.  The highs and lows include:Highs* Good price/value* Good suction (probably not as good as the Bissel it replaced however)* Relatively quiet for a vacuum in this price range* 12 AMP motor* Good at picking-up pet hair* Relatively light considering its size* All the right attachments (power brush, brush....)* Consumer Reports says that Dirt Devil vacs are among the most reliableLows* Emptying dirt the 'suggested' way by opening the bottom of the canister is a nuisance; it is much easier to empty from the top rather than using the bottom opening* The power cord says that it is 25 feet - it seems shorter* The hose assembly is a bit on the short side* To make the vacuum lighter it seems like they skimped a bit on the overall quality - hopefully it holds up over the long-run* The accessory brush falls out the holder when the vacuum is in useIt seems to work, it hasn't died yet and there is dust in the canister after I vacuum - all good things."

I read the reviews about this model and could disagree more about cords,auto height adjustments and all that crap,if you are so lazy that you can't bend over to plug in the cord,roll it up or adjust the height to match your carpet then maybe spend $4-600 more and get those things that make your life worth living the rest of us who can bend over and will be glad they save the cash on another great product that exceeds the basic need of getting rid of pet hair with plenty of power to spare. I know my house is cleaner because the A.C. filters are cleaner.Less dust and hair about the house,my dog of choice Ace,a German Shepherd who needs brushing everyday.I can pull my carpets back and see that the dirt has been removed,that fine dirt under the carpets,if you have throw rugs or carpets know what I am talking about. I have a Hoover that I hated to empty gave it away.$500.00 it did all that didn't match the suction of the Devil. I had a Dirt Devil feather lite died of abuse of being thrown in the closet  and finally broke so I can tell you Dirt Devil makes some tuff stuff cause it took about 10 years to finally break a wheel off.The motor is fine and still works great just a broken wheel.

Yes believe it or not, even the Dysons were not close to it.

I own another Dirt Devil vacuum which I only used for my bare floors and it is still 'sucking' as much for the past 4 years!The other vacuums I bought from different brands always end up beeing replaced because of poor quality, so after extensive research, trials, and MANY trips to the store exchanging vacuums left and right, I had to go with a trusted brand: this dirt devil! and I do not regret!!!"

Hands down the dirt devil beat my Kirby 10 times over.The cord could be longer and the power button could be in a different place, but other than that, I find nothing wrong with  this vac.  The pet brush attachment is great and I no longer have to worry about having dog hair on my clothing from our minature american eskimo.All in all, this machine is lightweight, does what it's supposed to and for the money I can afford to buy another one for the downstairs as opposed to what I spent on my Kirby 10 years ago. (have been using the kirby to clean out vehicles now, what a waste of money!) Just very happy to find a product that is a great value for the money."
"1073","XX","B003OA77MC","4.0","April 29, 2012","A3QMJMTLJC34QC","A Worthy Investment","When we bought the house some 11 years ago and at that time we purchased a Hoover Wind Tunnel vacuum cleaner that has served us well, but is starting to get a little long in the tooth, and has been retired upstairs where the work load is not that taxing.  So we started looking for a relatively in-expensive replacement, a machine that shipped with a tool to remove cat hairs.  I like Hoover, but my research led me to that Dirt Devil, specifically the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum ($121.36 at Amazon.com).In The Boxo Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuumo Attachment Toolso Instruction Bookleto Quick-start guideThe 'Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum' comes fully assembled complete with various cleaning attachments and tools, except for the handle which is attached via two screws.  I had the vacuum out of the box and sucking carpet in under 10 minutes.  The only other assembly required is to make sure the hose is inserted securely into the base of the vacuum.  The vacuum cleaner ships with three attachments/tools: electrostatic (pet) dusting brush, electrostatic turbo tool, and a 12' crevice tool, all of which can be attached to the hose by a 16' extender wand.  All of the attachments are stored in various places on the vacuum.  The handle does not fold down, but storing the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum in tight spaces has not proved problematic.UseThe Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum features a standard 12 Amp motor that is quieter that vacuums we have used in the past, but still noisy enough that watching television while vacuuming is impossible.  The vacuum has a 12' cleaning reach and 14' wide cleaning path, so vacuuming under end tables is not an issue.The Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum is not self-propelled, but the unit is so lightweight it feels as though it is.  The vacuum glides over the carpet with a minimum of effort while cleaning the carper effortlessly, something my wife likes because she has limited mobility.  The dust and dirt is sucked into the multi-stage cyclonic filtration system that features multiple chambers of filtration; said canister includes a rinsable HEPA filter.Cleaning the canister should be done with the utmost care however; the lack of a bag has its drawbacks.  The dust in the canister is very fine and has a habit of getting everywhere if one is not careful, despite that fact that dirt is emptied from the bottom of the dirt canister.  My advice empty the easy to remove canister out in the garage or back porch; anywhere but in the house where the fine dust can leave a grey coating everywhere.The extra-long hose when used with the 16' extender wand and 12' crevice tool extend the reach of the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum some 11 feet making stair cleaning so much more easier than before.  And because the unit is so light, it is not hard for my wife to pick up the unit and move it up a stair or two if need be.I love the air-powered electrostatic (pet) dusting brush; it removes cat hairs with ease.  Just attach the tool and the built-in brushes do their job well. Like most vacuum cleaners in this price range the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum features a 5-position multi-height adjustment knob for multiple floor/carpet use.  The knobs on our past vacuums have proved problematic; not so on this unit, the plastic knob turns with ease.ConclusionChecking in at just under $125.00 I feel as though we purchased a quality product in the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum.  In fact we like the vacuum so much we purchased another unit for upstairs!  Not a big, heavy and cumbersome as the Wind Tunnel is replaced the Dirt Devil UD70095 Bagless Upright Vacuum has proved itself to be the perfect little vacuum for our modest floor space."

It had a long hose, a cylinder which opens to release the accumulated dirt (no bags), an effective filter that blocks out pollen and pet dander, an attachment to vacuum upholstery, and a 12 amp motor that is robust.I bought this for my son who is allergic to everything and whose allergies really act up during the growing season. He gave it the greatest compliment he could 'it really sucks up dirt and I'm not sneezing and whizzing when I'm home'.My son doesn't have pets, but I bought this because it had good filtration.

We replaced it with this vacuum and have been very disappointed. It lacks two features that made the previous unit much easier to use:(1) The cord doesn't automatically retract. You need to manually wind it up after each use.(2) The vacuum doesn't automatically adjust its height. If you have carpets of varying thickness and/or bare floors, you'll need to keep re-adjusting the vacuum height.Neither of these is a deal breaker. But this vacuum is also much less effective than our old one at picking up dirt and fur. When I empty this vacuum after going through a room, there's less collected dirt than there was with our old vacuum. This is unacceptable given how expensive this vacuum is. It's also a puzzle, since Dirt Devil had apparently solved all of these problems in their previous product (which wasn't more expensive).We'll be buying a different brand next time."

This thing won't last you very long.  I spent $40 less on my 9 year old Dirt Devil and it was FAR better quality and much more substantial machine. First off, to be fair, I will say this unit was defective.  After two minutes use, it made a horrible whining noise.  I shut it off, restarted and it was fine for about one minute and started doing it again. While attempting to diagnose it, I noticed the brush head was tangled with cat hair after the first few minutes. This would explain why it wasn't picking up all of the debris in my home. It should be sucked into machine and not just twirled around the chintzy roller brush like spaghetti! This never happened on my old one. It also makes little balls out of cat hair and deposits them around the house, rather than sucking them up.  My house is small and extremely clean.  If this vacuum can't handle it, then what a shame! Also, the hose keeps coming unattached while in use.  The tools constantly fall off.  SO annoying.  The wheels are so cheap and don't roll nicely. No way will they last long.  When you empty the dirt container, it leaks out of the bottom, all over the floor and vacuum. I'm so disappointed that Dirt Devil has lowered their standards.  I assumed this would be a nice quality machine like my old one. On a side note, I may have received a previously returned vacuum.  The packing looked 'repackaged' and it seemed the machine was a little dusty. I will spend more $$ and get a better machine.  Back to researching....GRRR!"

When we tried it on our hardwood floors, we had to go over areas several time to get the dirt up. We used the hose with the attachment to vacuum around our windows and it would not even suck up the dust and dog hair off the window ledge.  The power cord significantly shorter than previous models. The quality of the materials used to construct it were poor and cheaply made. It was cheap plastic with no substance.  Our previous model was a lot more substantial. Yes it was lighter, but I would rather have the weight and have a product that is well made than something lighter not well made.  It was also a lot smaller in size so we had to empty the container more often. I requested the return label before my husband even finished vacuuming our first floor. We did not even bother trying it on the rest of the house. It went right back in the box and we returned it.  We are still waiting for the return credit to be issued from Amazon.

I have not livid here for very long, have two small short haired dogs and do not wear my shoes on the carpet. so I figured that there would not be much to vacuum up, but it was so surprising to see the amount of dust and debris in the collection container after just one pass with the dirt devil. It was so quiet too, I was able to hear the television over the quiet noise made by the vacuum, and the bag less system is wonderfully convenient.

The latch seems weak, but so far no problems.--The handle does not lower down close to horizontal for reaching under things.--The brush roller keeps spinning when handle is upright.--The power switch is foot-activated and is down by the switch that releases the handle. It is slightly awkward to use and it is too easy to feebly push the wrong switch if you are not paying attention.Order fulfillment and shipping was very fast. Good job Amazon.I hated the rubber-bristled dusting brush right away and have already ordered the regular dusting attachment (about 5 bucks including shipping). I am having a problem when using the hose. Although the machine does get raised when the handle is vertical, it is not enough. I am using it on a wall-to-wall, medium-pile carpet that has foam padding underneath. The machine is fairly hefty and sinks into the carpet enough so that the roller brush makes contact with the carpet even with the handle vertical and the knob set for a high pile. I am worried that if I left it this way too long it might eat a hole in the rug so I am thinking about ways of avoiding that possibility. Perhaps I can tip it back a bit while using the hose, or get a thin piece of plexi to stick under the power head.When moving the machine around while tilted back on its big wheels, with the handle locked up, the wheels sink deep enough so that the machine bottoms out and drags, making it harder to move it around that way.Wish list:Make it go higher when the handle is raised to vertical, or have it make the brush stop spinning.Put bigger rear wheels on it.Give it a brighter headlight.Reposition the foot-power switch, or put it up on the handle."

We have a dog and our home is subject to dust as we keep windows and slider open a lot. We read the reviews and landed on this one. Almost bought the Bissel. We bought this because of the cyclonic technology that claims to maintain consistent suction for a long time. We have used it for over a month now. It definitely picks up more dirt and dog hair than our previous vacuum. It grabs dirt deeper in the medium-shag carpet than our previous vacuum. The carpets have a renewed plumped up look after vacuuming. We would recommend this vacuum FOR ITS PRICE POINT ($105.00 at Amazon-how could you go wrong?) and for its initial effectiveness.Here's a detail of features and findings:1.) Ease of putting together-very easy (just the handle and clicking in the dirt container).2.) Electrical cord length-excellent (although I've already run over it and knicked it). Two room lengths.3.) The light is a joke: It does not illuminate anything.4.) The on-off switch is near the ground, just above the wheels to the left. It is a foot switch. If you have big feet, you're not going to be happy fitting your foot in here to turn it on/off.5.) This vacuum is not edge to edge: it does not go all the way to the baseboard but may be strong enough in suction to cover the small distance.6.) This vacuuming head does not lay down 100%- some vacuums are made to lay flat to go under furniture- this does not do that.7.) This vacuum does not have swivel wheels so it only makes straight turns.8.) This is a pretty strong vacuum. It picks up well but you do get dirt/dust showing on parts of the vacuum. You see dirt in the hose and in/on the canister.9.) Cleaning the dirt canister is very easy but be warned that you cannot avoid getting dirt/dust on or around you when you dump the canister and the canister must be wiped clean after.10.) The canister probably holds 2-3 complete vacuumings of a 2200 square foot place but we dump after each vacuum.11.) When vacuuming on non-carpet floors this vacuum does make a 'plasticee' vibrating noise which may be a/some part vibrating. It does not affect performance and goes away on carpet.12.) To vacuum stairs or under things you unplug the hose from the vacuum head and plug the hose into an attachment. The hose itself is not very long but for use it gets the job done on our stairs. If you're used to an all in one vacuum you have to get used to this new routine to do your whole house but its not big deal.13.) This vacuum does not deliver with the HEPA filter if that is a factor for you. We ordered one separately and received the wrong one so check the specs to get the correct part.14.) The smaller vacuum head is not motor driven. Its brushes turn by force of the suction and your moving it on surfaces. So, in essence its just a hose with a brush.We are happy with this vac. And as stated above, for the price point it seems like a super buy. I put the details in because the product detail and other customer reviews didn't mention any of this and if we had known some of this, we may have gone with another product. So if these things are important to you- you have the facts.Hope this helps."

So I have to loop it around the top of the vacuum handle, further shortening an already short cord.> The foot-switch power button is easy to accidentally bump and turn off the vacuum when you don't mean to.> The thing is very heavy.  It's a workout to use this, and I suggest a heart monitor if you're going to use it on carpeted steps.> The canister is not easy to empty.  Dirt does not just fall out of the bottom like magic, and I usually have to put on a glove and grab the dirt out by hand.  You can imagine how much dust this kicks up, meaning it has to be emptied out doors, while wearing a dust mask.And most importantly:> It does not clean floors well.

If you live anywhere near a pine tree, you'll save a lot of time by crawling over your floors and picking up pine needles with a pair of tweezers rather than trying to use this vacuum to pick them up.There is one thing it is good at: getting stuck on any sort of throw rug or door mat. It is best to put all floor mats in a safe location in a different house, perhaps in a different county, before using this vacuum."

My dog doesn't shed but I thought buying one specifically geared toward homes with pets would be a good idea and the other reviews were mostly positive. Unfortunately, we had to send this vacuum back and I am reconsidering my options and might switch to a canister one instead. I used it only one time and I knew right away it was not for me and might even have a defect. I did give it plenty of time to work and used it on an entire floor of my house - both on hard wood and on area rugs.The problems:- The vacuum spewed out way more dust and dirt than was originally on the floor! This really defeated the purpose and I had to keep going over the same areas again and again, only to have it spew more out more dust.- The hose kept falling off while I was vacuuming and getting in the way. It was very annoying and would not stay in place. If it happened only once or twice, that would be one thing, but this happened consistently.- The handle release feature that allows the handle to lower so you can easily vacuum sometimes would jam - it would work at times and then other times I couldn't get the handle to lower more than a couple of inches making it impossible to use.- I agree with the other reviews that said the vacuum was heavy. I knew that ahead of time and was willing to overlook that if it worked well, but I do want to mention that drawback.The suction did seem to work well but in all other areas, this vacuum failed me and I sent it back. Hopefully I just had a defective model but I was not willing to take the time to address these issues with Dirt Devil - it should work better out of the box than it did."

The vacuum still does a fine job of picking up dirt and hair from the carpets.  However, it has become very unreliable.  It overheats frequently...I can do about one room of vacuuming before it shuts off and I have to wait for 20 minutes for it to be usable again.  Maybe it could be fixed, but I would probably spend as much fixing it as I did on the vacuum in the first place.Good vacuum for the money!  I had a 5 year old Dyson that has slowly been dying on me and finally just quit.  This vacuum cost less than the repair to that vacuum would have cost, so I decided to try it.  I have only used it a couple of times, but so far I am very pleased with it.  It got a ton of cat hair and dirt out of the carpets (I have medium and deep pile carpets).  My only minor gripe is that the cord is shorter than on my old vacuum."

There is nothing to assemble aside from attaching the handle to the main body.It is not overly heavy. You will not endure a back ache or sore shoulder after using it. It is not a beast to carry up and down stairs.The first time the vacuum was put to use, it was amazing how much 'stuff' was sucked up and how many times the canister needed emptied as it seemed to pull out really ground in, old debris and hair. You would have never expected it by looking at the carpet before being vacuumed. The carpet itself actually looked better afterward though - it was more fluffed up and fresh looking. It really did an amazing job.After being in use for a few months now, it continues to suck up almost a ridiculous amount of pet hair and your regular everyday dust, lint, dirt, crumbs, and whatever else has found it's way onto the floors.This vacuum is used in a house with many cats - some longhaired and some short haired. Some are are just neighborhood strays that 'stop by' to lounge around, eat and visit with the other kitties and then are back outside as they wish. The fur that it picks up is amazing. The power is great - almost unbelievable.Such performance at such a great price is wonderful. It really gives me a whole new impression of the Dirt Devil brand.There have been no issues with clogs or malfunctions. Tools are useful, and easy to use. Crevice tool works great as well as the furniture attachment with beater brush. The hose is long enough to not have the vacuum falling over by trying to reach with the tools while in use and the cord is long enough as well so that you aren't switching outlets to get to different areas of the room.Highly recommended even if you do not have any pets, but especially recommended if you do have pets. It really is an amazing vacuum - no other words to describe the power - at a really great price."

The day before receiving it, I had vacuumed and steam cleaned my floors.  Once I received the new one, I had to test it out.  At first I was disappointed because it was so much quieter than my previous vacuum that I didn't think it was working very well.  Then I looked at the dirt canister and was absolutely amazed.  It was filled with pet hair and dirt that wasn't picked up from the full cleaning the day before.  So, not only does it clearly clean way better than any other vacuum that I have ever used, but it is also the quietest.  I also love how easy the canister clicks in and out, no fuss whatsoever.  The attachments are easy to get to but securely fastened with a long reach on the hose.  I haven't used the attachments yet, so I can't talk to how they work, but I expect they will do fine based on the suction power.  For the value, I don't think you can get a better unit."

I was worried this poor vacuum would break because of the heavy use on day one alone, but it is standing strong and I cannot imagine my weekly vacuuming of the house with any other vacuum.  I now get about two cylinders full of hair weekly, which is great.  I really feel like this thing gets ALL of the hair and dirt up!I love the pet hair attachment as well.  I have dark couches that my white dog's hair sticks to like glue...but with the pet hair attachment, I can clean my couches SO easily.  They look brand new after I am done with vacuuming them!  Of course, then my dog gets up on the couch and releases a new plume of hair all over the place, but hey...as long as I have this vacuum, I'm not worried about it!I love this vacuum so much, I have recommended it to several people, including my mom who also has a high shedding dog.  I have no experience with the Dyson Animal, which seems to be the highest rated pet vacuum, but I must say that this vacuum is excellent and I really have no complaints at all.  Maybe the ONLY thing I would like more would be a retractable power cord, rather than one I have to wrap after use.  That is a small annoyance that is easy to deal with though...otherwise, this vacuum is darn near perfect.In short, if you have pet hair everywhere, give this vacuum a shot!"

However, when first reviewing the unit I noticed that while the knob for carpet height turned, it made no contact with the wheels and didnt change the height.  My carpets were very dirty and had some surface pet hair, as I have several cats and my old vacuum had died a few weeks before. When I turned on the vacuum, it picked very little up even after multiple strokes; to add insult to injury it left dirt tracks in the carpet with each stroke! I thought for sure this must be a lemon and sent it back and requested a replacement, since so many of the comments for this model had been so positive.  The replacement arrived within a few days, but I was dismayed to find the exact same problem with the height adjustment knob. Worse yet, unbelievably...the exact same problem with not picking up the dirt in the rug and leaving tracks! The vacuum cleaner doesn't clean! I sent it back for a refund the same day.

I am happy to say that this vacuum performs better than expected.  I use it not only on the wood and carpeted floors, but also on the tile in the kitchen and the cement floors and area rugs in the basement.  The suction power is adequate, although has diminished a little over the couple of months I have had it, but I think I just need to clean the filters for better performance- our old vacuum was terrible and I was getting massive amounts of dirt out of the carpets every time I vacuumed (which was every other day, because we were trying to get rid of fleas).  This vacuum really got put through its paces the first month or so and did a good enough job that I actually looked forward to using it!  It does have a little bit of dirt kick-back that can be obnoxious, but I think that is a problem that most vacuums will have on a hard surface, so I can't complain too much.

As others have mentioned, the cord is only moderately long, so if you have a big house, you will need to replug several times as you move through your house.  The canister is also not too large, and will have to be emptied out several times, which I didn't mind, because it was much easier to do than my old Hoover due to design, and it goes to show that the vacuum cleaner is thoroughly sucking dust up.  Emptying was not messy.  Washing the filters and canister is easy. Overall, very very satisfied with this vacuum. Great price too!"

Sure, like other pet owners, there are the stray hairs and the consolidated bed areas where they gather in piles, but mostly its these little black balls that get pushed into the carpet by walking. This vacuum, so far ( a handful of weeks now), has done a splendid job dealing with this hair problem. It has yet to put out that horrific dirty vacuum smell into the air, pulls up cat hair from rugs, carpets and vinyl easily. I find it too be a pretty good weight, easy to maneuver and the attachments rest well in their respective places although occasionally the red extension piece slips out of place if not put in place perfectly. I don't think they feel as cheap as a few other vacuums I have used in recent memory, so I have high hopes that they will last for a while.Although others assure me otherwise, I thought the handle area felt a bit cheap, especially when I put it together. It just feels like the kind of plastic that could crack with unexpected pressure. I've emptied the canister a few times. The first time was a little dicey and got a bit messy as things fell out prematurely, but overall, probably a piece of cake for people, unlike myself, who have used canisters before.I've not had a lot of lasting experience with Dirt Devil in the past, but I can already tell this is a sturdier product than the light weight vacuums I have had from them in the past.

It also has a long hose to get into those smaller areas, the Turbo Tool is great for cleaning furniture and the edge to edge cleaning means it gets right up the edge of where you are cleaning.When you are done, the Dirt cup releases easy and it empties from the bottom, so just press a button and all the dirt just drops out.The one con is that is it big and bulky, there are some places it just can't get into and it is heavy, so if you have a lot of carpet, it could get tiresome pushing this vacuum around.But overall, this is the best vacuum I have owned and definitely do recommend it."

You push the button on top to release the canister.  Bring it to the trash bin and flip the bottom by pressing the side button.  This you will need both hands, one to push the button and one to push down the bottom.Maneuverability though is a tougher issue. This vac is heavy, specially for my wife. It drags her down specially working her way through the stairs and to from one floor to the another.We have another vacuum where the cord rolls automatically inside the canister by simply stepping on a switch.

I paid $80 at Walmart for it. It has a filter that is not rinsible, and it costs $20 to replace it.My vacuum has the pet tool too. The only thing I have noticed with mine...you have to be watchful and not get anything like a t-shirt/sock caught in it for over 7 seconds because it will burn up the belt. Pick up your floors before you vacuum. I have replaced the belt 3 times in a year.I have a 52 lb short haired dog indoors in a 1100 square foot home. I have to vacuum at least once a week....I sweep every day. I use the vacuum on average 5 times a month. I have hard wood floors and one 4x6 thin area rug.My biggest complaint would be the smell that comes from the vacuum after a month. I'm pretty clean, but my dog must have smelly skin cells. I bathe her regulary too. So, when you turn the vacuum on there is a dog smell that stinks...even if the plastic canister is empty. When you replace the $20 filter the smell goes away for a short time. I use the filter with the baking soda additive in them.My second complaint would be that on my hardwood floors...I feel the vacuum throwing the dirt on the floor back at my feet behind the vacuum. It has always done that. It picks up 75% of what is on the floor. I use the hose and go back and forth over the floor to pick up the flung out dirt.The pet tool works great/impressive...just don't get big pieces or chunks or anything stringy caught in it.That's it. Overall Dirt Devil has great customer service. If you have an issue or complaint they are very nice and helpful. I don't have to wait too long either to speak to someone.Also, I forgot to add...the detachable hose for the tools reattaches for mine very insecurely. When it's attached it's on, but you have to keep your eye on it. There has been many numerous times when I thought I was vacuuming, but the connector hose was detached without my knowledge...so I was blowing everything I was vacuuming back out into the air. It just comes loose sometimes for me."

I am happy with this lightweight, easy to use vacuum!My old Hoover vacuum, even though its not that old, has stopped sucking like it used to.  I haven't taken it in to get it looked at.  I had the opportunity to try this vacuum out, so I thought I would take it.  I can sure see how much my old vacuum was missing.  I filled the canister in just one vacuum swipe of my small apartment.  I have a cat, and most of it was cat hair!  I vacuumed around her cat box, and it picked that up well.  My carpet is worn out, so it is hard to get into the depth of it.  This vacuum didn't pick up all the cat litter, however, I was able to pick it up with the plastic brush attachment that came with it.  It picked it up, and didn't shoot it all over the place like some vacuums do.A couple things that I don't care for on this vacuum are the hose attachment and the on/off switch.The hose attachment goes into the base of the vacuum to stop the suction from the hose.  It came out once on me.  You have to make sure it is in there tight, and even then it loosened a little by the time I was done vacuuming.  It has to be in there, or the vacuum won't suck as well and stuff will shoot out of the hose.The on/off switch is on the back of the base of the vacuum, next to the switch that releases the vacuum from and locked in stand up position.  It is kind of hard to turn off, as you need to use your foot.  It isn't a big deal, but I prefer the switch to be on the handle.This vacuum comes with attachments that attach to the vacuum in convenient, out of the way places.  The vacuum has a roller on it, that brushes the carpet and fluffs it.  It has different height adjustments for different lengths of carpet, or bare floor and you can adjust it by rotating the lever.  The canister is easy to remove, and has a trap door style bottom that empties easily into the garbage.  I did have to use my hand to get all of the crud out of it.  This left the outside of the canister dusty, so I wiped it off with a damp cloth.So far I am impressed with this vacuum.  It was easy to attach the handle with a Philips screwdriver, and I didn't have to read the manual before I used it.  This is a really user friendly vacuum."

I have been VERY unhappy with a Dyson DCO7 that I've suffered with for the last 5 years and couldn't wait to try something else, even something this inexpensive.  You never know, maybe it might actually work better!IT DOES!  I am here to tell you that this very low priced Dirt Devil cyclonic upright is every bit the vacuum my Dyson is and MORE!  One of the biggest complaints I have had with the Dyson is the way their attachments connect to the machine. It is always a huge fight getting them on and then off and more than one attachment has broken in the process even though I was always very careful with them. I am happy to report the included attachments that come with this Dirt Devil are built as well or better than my Dyson attachments and they GO ON AND OFF EASILY! It makes this vacuum a real joy to use.  The extender wand attachment, the extra hose, the furniture attachment, the crevice tool. they are all totally functional and  really easy to put on and take off the vacuum.The hose is plenty long enough too and the power cord is long enough to keep replugging down to a minimum. It really is amazing how much you get for your money with this thing.  The filters need to be cleaned /replaced occasionally and that can be a  real pain, but I have had to do that for the last 5 years with my Dyson and I am used to it now.  As for the effectiveness of the Electrostatic Turbo tool I can't really speak to that as we don't have any pets.  However I did use it on a large couch that had not been vacuumed or cleaned in the last 2 years after the Dyson attachments gave up on me and it got the couch VERY clean.  To see for myself how much dirt and hair the tool removed I first started with an empty dirt cup so I could actually SEE what was picked up. I am embarrassed to tell you just how much, but believe me when I say it was sizable! (yikes!)SO how does the Dirt Devil measure up to my much more expensive Dyson in the actual vacuuming department?  In a word: BETTER!  I am trying hard to avoid the old clich&eacute; in describing this Dirt Devil but I just can't resist.....It REALLY SUCKS! (but in a good way!) Honestly, after using the Dyson for more than 5 years and then trying the Dirt Devil in the same areas of carpet and tile flooring I was VERY pleased to find just how much more dirt and crud I was picking up with the Dirt Devil.  I did not expect this level of performance from something this inexpensive.  I guess I was just suffering from some vacuum cleaner prejudice.I want to reiterate that the overall build quality of this vacuum is very good. I was not expecting so much for so little.  I wish I could have purchased one of these Dirt Devils 5 years ago instead of wasting so much money on my now much maligned Dyson.Bottom Line, the Dyson is being stored in the garage just in case, and the Dirt Devil is now occupying the place of honor in our utility closet. Way to go Dirt Devil, you really do SUCK! (ooops, there I go again!)"

I searched other review sites and found that not to be the case. It just happens that several Amazon buyers were unhappy mostly about the product being heavy or had delivery problems. Over the years I have had different brands and this Hoover Platinum is the best I have ever used. I have had Dirt Devil, Kenmore, Dyson, Eureka and Panasonic. None of them have come near the power for deep cleaning that this Hoover provides. I have 6 rooms in my home with plush carpeting. Everytime I use this product the rooms look as if new rugs had been installed. I think the only problem may be the product's weight. It's not a problem for me I am 5 feet, 10 inches - 210 pounds: semi - tough New Yorker. Its best advantage is its powerful 12 amp motor. It's a strong work horse. In conclusion this product provides the most cleaning power in its price range - $299.00 via Amazon.Com LLC."

It picked up much more then the older upright units I have used.2. The ease of emptying the dust bin is quick, efficient, and the least messy of all three bag-less I have had, two of which I still own.3. If it could be improved upon it would be.a. heavier duty hose, but that would add weight and would not have as tight of a bend radius.b. attachment connections kept on the canister, but that would add bulk, thus another trade off.c. cord rewind seems a bit weak, time will tell.4.

The floor tool doesn't store on-board and un-attaches easily.  The other tools store on the handle and like to fall off. The little stubby front wheel gets stuck even on low carpets. When you pull the vacuum on a carpet the front comes up a bit and the back of the unit drags on the carpet. Kind of like a dog dragging it's butt on the floor. Then there is the very annoying noise that comes from the hose where it attaches to the vac. The only good things I can say about this vac is the Bag-less feature works well, and the swivel power head is easy to use. But one big problem with the bag-less is it can't balance on a step if you are cleaning stairs. Recently the beater head started operating intermittently.I fixed the problem in the hose that was from a design flaw. However the repair didn't last long and I decided to cut my loses and replace the unit. I just bought a Panasonic from Amazon that is just like and old Kenmore I once had. No gimmicks just a plain old school Vac with the attachments on-board. And as it is a bag model it will fit on stairs. Hoover was once my favorite vacuum.

Here I should've listened to others!)2) The base canister is HEAVY and bulky - even thought the actual footprint isn't big3) The wand/handle often 'falls' from the upright position stance either because of lack of locking or weight4) The handle is... well...annoying...I often hit the on/off button and in reality there is no need to have designed this complicated looping handle5) The foot activated switch to change the elevation of the vac from the floor has not worked properly from day 1.  I can step on it over & over & over and sometimes nothing happens, sometimes it simply skips the heigh I select6) Doesn't vac non-carpeted floors well with the floor attachements  (I am often left going around with just he bare wand or resorting to my Black & Decker Pivot Vac (AWESOME product))7) Bag-less schmaggless - all the blah-blah about 'clean' emptying is talk.  If you put the canister over / into the garbage and hit 'bombs away' you are greeted with a cloud of dust (unless you have a really tall and empty garbage can)8) Only 2 accessory attachement items are stored on board (on the handle actually) - and not well as they often get 'knocked' off when using the vacWhat's positive?A) It does vacuum fairly well on wall to wall carpets.B) The cord is in fact a nice lengthI honestly wish to dump this product and buy a Miele - but I can't afford to do either."

The suction was good and it seemed to be a pretty solid machine...except it has had continual problems. The first problem was about 6 months after purchase. The machine's power would not stay on. I took it in to the shop and they had to replace the hose (the power button is on the end of the hose) because some plastic ring/seal had cracked. This took 2-3 weeks to get a replacement hose. Less than a year later the machine would not turn on at all so back to the shop it went. This time I was told that they had to replace the entire vacuum (I was told that the motor was dirty...hello, it's a vacuum cleaner...it's supposed to get dirty and I religiously clean the filters). This time it took about 2 weeks. I have a second vacuum cleaner (a Dyson) and decided that I would just stick with Dyson (I have had 3 and have NEVER had a problem...never even having to replace the belt on a 7 year old machine).Ultimately, for the money, I would recommend going with a Dyson as the difference in cost is minimal (I paid $300 for this Hoover, $320 for a Dyson DC23 animal canister vacuum and $250 for a Dyson DC33 multifloor upright vacuum). While the Hoover may feel slightly more solid than the Dyson, the Dyson's reliability is superior by far.The Hoover salesmen (at the repair place I take this vacuum) also completely turn me off from Hoover vacuums. They consistently bash Dysons and have told me that I shouldn't have purchased a canister (bagless) vacuum as they were not recommended for desert areas (making it sound like the problems with the vacuum cleaner is my fault, not the company that made the inferior piece of equipment). I have NEVER seen anything, anywhere, by any vacuum company that said that canister (bagless) vacuums should not be purchased in desert areas and my Dyson DC14 worked so well for 7 years that I was able to sell it when I decided to switch to a canister vacuum.After this experience I have become a diehard Dyson fan and will NEVER go back to Hoover."

The suction is as good as I expected - particularly important for the area rugs; the extra attachments provided are excellent (I'm especially happy with the wooden floor head; I haven't tried the pet hair one yet). In an ideal world all the attachments would fit on the machine somewhere (not just the thin tube and small brush which are attached to the handle and occasionally come off when they are knocked) and the machine would be slightly lighter to pull around.  However, these are more in the way of suggestions to the manufacturer, rather than complaints. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."

Right away, I was surprised at how heavy it was. It can not be taken quickly from location to location. Do not buy this if you have multiple levels of your home!!!  SO, right away I noticed that it lacked suction. I thought, well it is quite, maybe because I have been used to 30years of bagged vacumes.  Well, the dirt/dust/hair just gets blown all over the room.  When the dust, etc, settles, you need to vacume again!!! I kept thinking it would get better, so I was patient. Each time blaming myself for not following directions.  I have kept it clean, eptied after each use.  My husband has looked at it, and nothing is blocking the tubes, it is clean. It still will not pick up a tiny piece of paper(Notebook paper)  I will try and call the number on monday, but after reading all the problems with customer service, I do not expect anything.  THis was REALLY expensive, the most I have spend EVER on any vacume. My last TWO did not equal to this one.  I am stuck with this one until it breaks, or it finally breaks me.

I can't comment on long-term reliability, but I'll summarize my first impressions from using it several times to clean my house, which is mostly hardwood floors, with several area rugs.Pros:- Effective cleaning. The carpet attachment is powerful and effective with dust, lint, and dog hair.- Maneuverability. Based on size, shape, and Consumer Reports, I expected the large carpet & floor attachment to be difficult to maneuver. It is large and heavy, but it swivels easily on large, smooth wheels.- Attachment selection: The choice of wide brush attachment for hard floors, or the carpet attachment with the brush turned off, is convenient.- Dust container detaches easily and neatly for emptying it elsewhere (e.g. outside).Cons:- HEAVY. Also, main vacuum body is also wide and bulky, and the carpet cleaning attachment is heavy, making carrying the whole thing quite a chore.- Hard floor brush attachment doesn't stow on-board. I use this brush a lot, and since the vacuum itself is unwieldy, I don't really have a hand free for this.- The wand release button is on the carpet attachment. So if you have it detached and you are using the hard floor brush instead, you can't quickly remove the wand to use the dusting brush or crevice attachment directly on the handle/nozzle. For me, this is a pretty major inconvenience. You have to either keep the wand on (it telescopes, so you can push it in to a little over half its length, but still awkward for up-close work) or put the carpet attachment on and then release it and the wand together (that requires hauling it to rooms where you don't actually use it).- As others have pointed out, the carpet attachment is the only one that engages with a latch - all the others rely on friction, and tend to fall off easily.- Dust 'cup' is a huge canister with many layers of plastic, and as another reviewer observed, once it's dirty, it's dirty. There are areas that can't be accessed for cleaning.I will probably keep this, because I upgraded specifically for the carpet-cleaning performance. Unfortunately, there are few highly-rated bagless canisters available. But I am only giving it 3 stars, because for the price, the engineers should have designed these features more thoughtfully, with real-world use and convenience in mind. The jury's still out on durability."

The first one I bought in January I sent back the same day - electrical problems - it kept shutting off.  I switched to another distributor and ordered another one.  It just got here today (1 month after my first one).  I thought that my first experience was just bad luck - that maybe I was just  one in a million that got a defective machine.  Ha!

This canister caught my attention. I was worried with the handful of poor reviews that were listed here in Amazon.com, but felt confident enought to take the plunge (but I've kept everything, just in case!).It's been over a month and we are VERY pleased.  The cord, which some reviewers complained was too short (and I was worried about) is just dandy in length! Ample distances can be reached. The little attachments do pop out of their holder on the handle; easy fix, just keep them with the other attachments in storage! The handle telescopes - a great feature for us, since we are taller than your average bear. The power of the machine coupled with it's AMAZING quietness is the real gem.The canister is not too messy to empty. It will be easier when the snow is gone and we can empty it outside by the garage trash bin, which is bigger than our kitchen one, but it is not that big a deal.We are very pleased with the quality and performance of this and hope that it remains as it is now for a long time!"

All I can say is Buyer Beware!I bought this vacuum (which was expensive!!) thinking I was going to get a quality vacuum. It comes with a 6-year manufacturer warranty, so I thought that there wouldn't be any issues for at least 6-years, because that seems to be how warranties are, right? WRONG!!! I had this vacuum for 1 day, and the power on/off button & powerhead on/off button failed. For some reason, the buttons wouldn't turn off at the handset -- they just stayed lit up. And no, I did not abuse this machine in any way. I emptied the cannister several times during vacuuming thru my house.Here's how it went: I spent about 30 minutes on my downstairs and then let the unit rest (so I could rest); and then went to do the upstairs about 20 minutes later. After running the vacuum for about 5 minutes, I couldn't operate the handset control buttons (on/off and powerhead). So I unpluged the unit from the outlet and then plugged it back in and the control buttons wouldn't work at all (now they wouldn't even light up). After doing a little research on this (which I should have done more of to begin with), I found out that other people had the same issue. Some had it from when they just put the vacuum together and tried to use it for the first time. Others had it happen within the first month or two. So my recommendation to you is DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!I wouldn't be surprised if Hoover ends up doing a recall on this piece of junk (which I'm putting nicely). In an attempt to find out how long I would be without a vacuum, I called the closest Hoover warranty service center (which was about 24 miles away). The shop guy told me that they are no longer a service center for Hoover, and apologized. He asked me what kind of vacuum I had and I told him it was the Hoover Platinum Cyclonic Bagless Canister and he said that I unfortunately purchased a 'nightmare vacuum'. He went on to tell me that Hoover is horrible to deal with on warranty repairs. He said that many times the repair parts are on back order and sometimes customers are without their vacuums for weeks. That's when I knew what I had to do - RETURN IT!!! Thankfully, Wal-Mart has a great return policy -- they get 5 STARS for that!! So I just returned it today, and I'm happy to say that it's going back to Hoover as a Defective Product!Anyway, I just bought the Dyson DC23. I just used it and it's AWESOME!! It has incredible suction and I am soooo much happier now! My goal in giving this review is that other customers don't spend their hard earned money on a defective product. If you are still considering purchasing it, just be sure to do lots of research on it so that you will see that I'm not the only one that experienced this type of problem."

Now that I am Mr. Mom and have taken over many (not all) of the home chores, found that this machine was the 'Beast From HELL!' Was like driving a 65 ton tank through a drive up window at a bank...

I started doing much research trying to find the right solution for my back ache and getting the job done right to pass my self imposed inspection. The Hoover Platinum Cyclonic Bagless Canister Vac. Model S3865 was my selection and it just arrived today, 'YES!' Our home for 36 years is approx 1,800 sf and we have replaced the carpet with all tile (20%) and hardwood (80%)flooring about 7 months ago.  Now for the test, I first put in a fresh bag in the old Up-Right 6.9 and and vacuumed everything not nailed down, then I did it all over again with my new Hoover S3865. OMG, was I shocked at how much stuff this new machine picked up!! The low profile power head got under and around almost everything and I had to move very little to achieve total floor cleaning. With the Beast I had to move everything to try and get the job done with poor results. Folks, the canister was half full of fine dust, dirt and crap from I do not know where?? This new Hoover was like gliding over ice, one tenth the effort, the swivel power head is the best and very maneuverable with outstanding side/edge pick-up and this thing is very quite too. I used all the attachments with the handle and also with the extension tube, what a blessing it is to use this stuff, gets the job done and the back ache gone!! I did picture frames, base molding, cracks and crevices, window ledges ceiling fans, vent registers, you name it, it all met with my new Hoover and lost the war on dust, dirt, dog and people hair, all now in the waste can.  I went to my wife and asked her forgiveness for not getting this Vac sooner and she asked what took me so long to see the light??

Our friends have one of the Dyson canister vacuums and I was initially going to buy one of those, as it really does clean quite well. However after reading the reviews and doing some more comparisons, I settled on the Hoover Platinum since it had a couple of features I thought where nice:- Better control location. Hoover has the on/off, brush roll and suction level switch right on the handle. The pedals on the power nozzle are easily operated by foot.- When the hose is attached to the power nozzle, it will lock upright and remain standing on its own.- Hose attaches directly to the front of the canister, not angled to the side.Other positive points:- Very quiet motor and nozzle- Bright light on the power nozzle- Easy to see indicator lights- Balanced cord retraction system (strong but not too fast)- Easy to empty canister (Some reviews said this was messy but for us not any messier than changing out the bag on our old upright. Our solution: get a large garbage can, put the end of the canister into it, push button and your done)It is not without a few drawbacks however:- No clip for securing the hose when you have to store or move the unit- Extend-able wand is easy to extend but is somewhat cumbersome to use by itself- Indicator lights remain on while unit is plugged in but not operating. They are LED lights but still why waste energy?Overall my wife is happy with her new vacuum and I have been pretty impressed with its quality.

What no one tells you is that for hard floors you have to take the motorized head off and put the very-common-no-moving-parts-head on.  Well, geez, any vacuum can clean a hard floor once you do that but unfortunately, on this model, that head constantly falls off while in use.  With the motorized head on, it will not pick up sand off a tile floor.  With the no-moving parts head on, it still takes repeated passes over sand to pick it up.  The no-moving parts head does work fine on pet hair on the tile floor, if it would stay on.  This vacuum works fine on my rugs. The best thing about this vacuum was how easy it was to empty the canister and how easy it was to pull the canister around.  The automatic cord winder is nice too.

Had Sears Kenmore previously which lasted me 17 years with only one repair. Thought I would try another brand thinking the technology may have come a long way. Did a lot of internet research and chose this Hoover. However, I am not overly impressed. Let's start with the pros: it's bagless... 6 yr. warranty... love the under furniture swivel action... not too noisy... telescoping handle comes in handy. The cons are: bulky to handle... not powerful enough... attachments don't click into handle (including beater bar) so they keep disconnecting from handle while vacuuming... floor brush has no spot to be held on canister... retractable cord has to be fed back in, does not retract on it's own... beater bar does not pick up everything on carpets even at the lowest setting. Having said all that, I think the negatives outweigh the positives. It does an OK job but not great. I'm disappointed."

Sadly, in my opinion, it really should have better suction and I've got it at max suction on the appropriate floor/carpet setting. Also, it's a bit heavy and cumbersome. Unfortunately there weren't any stores anywhere in my area that carried these in house for me to demo before I bought. I would not buy it if I had the chance to do it over."
"1195","XX","B002GHBRX4","4.0","April 6, 2010","A238ZK9FQKQFC8","Solid performer for this price point","To start, I should mention that I'm hard on vacuums. We have different flooring types, multiple levels in the house, animals, long hair and children, as well as living in a never ending construction zone in the center of allergy alley.  Thus, I need a fairly heavy performing vacuum that manages flooring transitions as well as being able to do stairs and furniture.If that weren't asking a lot already, I need it to be heavy enough to be multifiltered and high powered, but light enough that I can tote it up the stairs.I've had the Platinum Hoover Canister for a 3 months now, and I've been pleased with the performance.  This one replaced a previous Windtunnel, and while I miss a few things from the old version (like different power settings), all in all, the new version outperforms the older version.Pros:Suction is fantastic.  Transitioning from area rugs to hardwoods and then to carpet is easy.  Super long power cord lets you do multiple areas without having to unplug and replug. Filters, filters, filters.  Allergies in the house have become noticeably better with this unit. It's a lot more quiet that previous versions.  Powerhead is fantastic for getting critter hair off the furniture and drapes. Reset button on the main head is a wonderful thing, if like me, you have ninja shoelaces in unlikely places; such as those cleverly hidden by small children who have kicked their shoes under the couch.  Almost no dust escapes the vacuum while it is running, and while it is all in one unit...but that leads us to the cons...Cons:Emptying this vacuum is not for the wheezy.  You will get dirty, you will have a cloud of dust, you will curse yourself and the Hoover engineers if you make the mistake of emptying it in the house.  Trust me on this one.  The only good way to empty it is to take the canister out to your big trash can, standing upwind and praying.As well, the canister has collection areas that cannot be touched, washed or otherwise cleaned.  I realize that the engineering design behind this was to keep the user away from the dirt, but it also means that if something gets caked in there, like if you clean on a humid day...you're kinda hosed. (No pun intended....ok, a *little* intended.) It's as though the engineers had *seen* someone use a vacuum, but didn't actually vacuum anything themselves, and so hadn't quite worked through the final step of cleaning the vacuum itself.Still, the minor inconvenience of what I think is a poor engineering decision on that one part, is outweighed by the performance, the price point, and the significant reliability that I've gotten from other Hoover products.For a neat person with a small space, this vacuum is probably overkill...but for large houses filled with dirt tracking children and animals...this vac is a clear winner in it's price range."

I had it 1 wk and 3 days and used it one time, the wand where you turn on/off didn't turn the machine off you had to unplug from the wall.I called Hoover and they told me to take it to the one & only repair shop for Hoover in Rochester,NY. I took it in and they said about 2-3 wks. (the circuit board had failed.) Well I waited 4 wks then called them and they said the parts from Hoover are on b/o status. I called Hoover and ask if they would replace the machine and the girl said yes you have waited long enough. Well long story short she didn't, she made me wait for the b/o parts. Then I called Hoover back and got a manager on the phone and ask who from Hoover is going to clean my house since it is going on 5 wks w/o a vacuum to clean with. She made a call that day to the shop and they told her the same thing they were told parts on b/o status. Then she called me back and said a new machine was on it's way.

I received it mid-week and am so impressed with how well it cleans. My carpets are 15 yrs old, and I swear, I could see the color return more to original with the dirt lifting out with the vacuum.It was easy assembly, and fairly easy to pull around from place to place. The powerhead is quite wide & this seems to be giving me the most problems, as it is wider than my previous sweeper, but I'm sure I'll get used to the maneuverability of the powerhead. Also, the hose feeds into the very bottom of the cannister (I think this  is part of the 'cyclonic' design), and I often seem to be pulling the cannister up, instead of along.The suction is impressive, and I prefer being able to dump dirt (and dog hair) as needed as opposed to waiting for a bag to fill. The prior sweeper I had was also bagless, so I'm somewhat familiar with needing to be directly over the trashcan before dumping the dusty load. This model is fairly easy to empty, but again, you need to be right over your trash container.I like the auto shutoff feature on the powerhead (found this out when I sucked up a sock with first running!). That should save on belts in the future. The telescoping wand is a nice feature, and the cord seems to be of more-than-adequate length.One huge determining factor in my purchase was the 6 year warranty offered by Hoover. I realize I am still in the 'honeymoon' phase, and comparing my 10 yr old Fantom with this new Hoover, but I am quite impressed so far & would recommend it at this point."

I analyzed my real cleaning needs and decided it was time for a canister vac, since our floors are wood and tile with just a few area rugs. South Florida has peculiar cleanling issues, too. Several reviews later, I found this model Hoover and read nothing discouraging about it except for the weight. No one stocked this machine within all of South Florida, so I ordered it from Amazon. I didn't have to pay shipping and it arrived right away.  The machine cleans thoroughly and it easy to operate, although it is weighty; I particularly love the fact that there are no bags, it has a HEPA filter and no dust escaping into the air. My one slight negative about it is that it could have better suction on the carpets (it is true that there is nothing like an upright for this)however, my house has not been this clean since we first moved in six years ago.  I highly recommend this machine to anyone who has a lot of tile to sweep and sliding glass door troughs to clean.

I have yet to have seen even a shop vac in an industrial environment that is dirtier than this.  Plus, it's not hardly effective at all.  The canister is easy to use, but the seal/filter system is poorly designed. It is easy to have the canister unnoticeably misaligned blowing dirt everywhere.  If it is lined up correctly, dirt surrounds the outside of the canister while in the inside of the vacuum and, as you take it out, drops dust/dirt everywhere.  All of that also assumes the hosing attachment stays connected in the back.  Mine doesn't and it's easy to miss; thus, once again, dirt goes everywhere.  It's aggrivating vacuuming a room only to find out you just made it worse and now have to clean/check every surface in the room.  The attachments are pretty much for show and that includes the hose.  On top of that, this flop is cumbersome and difficult to push...and I'm a 200+ lb. man.  This is so poor a product that Bissell should be ashamed.

You will fill the dirt cannister only about a quarter of the way and as the dirt spins around, instead of distributing equally throughout the cannister, it piles up one side of the vacuum and quickly quits suctioning anything. Emptying it is as dirty a task as you could imagine. The filters plug up almost everytime you use it, and the whole thing needs to be torn down for cleaning. I am so fed up with this cyclonic piece of junk, I can't say what I really think on this site, but understand, it is not worth buying in any shape or form.

Details:","I bought this machine on the spur of the moment because my previous vacuum cleaner broke and this one seemed to be specifically designed to deal with pet hair. So, it's my own fault I'm so unhappy with this machine.  Some specific problems:- This vacuum is heavy, but it has no flat surfaces which would allow it to be picked up and moved easily. It's dangerously awkward.  You'll be able to give up your gym membership if you buy this machine.- The machine is mostly composed of hard plastic. It is the least 'flexible' machine I've ever owned.  This hard plastic is going to break sooner, rather than later.- Maintenance is horrific. Dirt and hair accumulate everywhere, but you need a degree in mechanical engineering to figure out how to disassemble and re-install the hard-plastic 'cyclonic' tube feature in the upper part of this made-in-Korea vacuum. It's obvious that that item needs to be removed from the machine in order to get to all the pet hair which accumulates in the upper part of the machine, but getting that item in and out of the machine is a nightmare. The plastic is totally unyielding, so one is afraid to put too much twist onto the item for fear of the hard plastic breaking.  A person who is not mechanically inclined would very possibly be unable to remove the item; getting it back in is just as bad and isa matter of operating in the blind.- The vacuum hose separates from the body of the vacuum very easily.  This means that if you are vacuuming you may discover that you were actually sucking up absolutely nothing.  The motor is so noisy that you would possibly not even notice that the machine was not actually vacuuming.  So get prepared to have to do it all over again once you re-connect the hose to the body of the machine.- It takes 2 people to use this machine on a set of stairs; it's just too dangerous and awkward do it alone.The one nice feature of this model - it got a really long power cord, and that's about it."

Do not buy this vacuum because you will be very disappointed.The only good thing about this vacuum was the upholstery cleaning attachment.  I will keep this and use it with my other vacuum.  That being said it is not worth buying this just for one attachment because the vacuum does not work and you won't be able to use it anyway.  Unless you have a vacuum that already works.The worst part about this vacuum is that it has poor suction.  The first time I used it, it worked okay.  Every time after that now it just gets worse and worse.  The only thing you can do is completely take apart the machine to get it working again, but that only lasts for one vacuuming session then you have to do it again.  This is very messy and annoying.  The canister is way to small.  I vacuum about once a week and I have a dog with short hair.  This vacuum will do half a room and then needs to be emptied.  The canister is also poorly designed.  Only the bottom of the canister slides out of the machine. Every time you take it off dust and hair will fall on the machine especially if you vacuum to much and overfill the bottom.  Needless to say the vacuum gets dirty very quick and you loose about 25% of what you just vacuumed up onto the machine and floor.  The vacuum itself is large and bulky and not easy to vacuum around things.  It originally came with a hair magnet attached to the front.  I quickly removed this because it did nothing and is just in the way.  The switch to turn it on is on the front of the machine and it is small.  Why would you put the switch on the front where you can't see it.  Every time you want to turn it off or on you have to stop and look around the front for the switch.  This is just bad design.  The attachments hook to the handle, but fall off all the time.This vacuum is terrible.  It is called a pet hair eraser, but pet hair will easily kill this machine.  It can not handle carpet very well.  Expect to make a dozen passes before it is at all clean and there still will be dirt lines left behind.  This machine finally got to me about 9 months after using it.  It would not pick anything up and I was sick and tired of taking it apart so I smashed it into pieces on my back porch.  It seemed to be the best use for this vacuum.Do not buy this.  It will make you angry every time you use it until you decide enough is enough.

It also claims that the HEPA filter catches 99.9% of all dust and dander, yet we could wipe the dust off the outside of the vacuum and the inside of the HEPA door. It took 3 or 4 swipes at an area to clean it because it would spit stuff backwards at your feet. Horrible, awful vacuum. We bought it today and will be returning it when the store opens tomorrow. Don't be fooled by the claims the vacuum makes and it's reasonable price, it will fail you."

I bought it to supplement the 40 dollar Wal Mart Bissell vacuum because I have 3 indoor cats. I thought I would be impressed by the pet hair eraser tools to get the cat hair off the couch.  This vacuum was constantly getting clogged and unclogging it is a pain and very messy. The overall suction started off great and then declined quickly.  Yes, the filters have been changed.  The dirt container is SMALL and needs to be emptied about every room.  Emptying it also causes dust to fly everywhere.  The motor burned out after about 20 uses.  Even if the motor worked fine, the mess that this vacuum creates with its frequent emptying and clogging is enough to rate it 1 star.My cheap Bissell still works great after 4.5 years.

(That was vacuuming two medium sized rooms and a hallway once every 1-2 weeks.) Totally not worth the money and the landfill space.I have 3 big issues with this machine:1) It broke in about 1 year2) It has a bag-less chamber that the dirt and whatnot SHOULD fall into, but in reality, all the dirt and dust gets trapped up inside the non-removable filter area (you can remove the filter, but not that upper chamber). This is such a pain in the ass to clean and deal with--the machine gets filthy, your hands get filthy, the ground around you gets filthy--and that's just about every time you vacuum.3) When using the hose, the main body of the vacuum is unstable and almost always falls over (unless I hold onto it with one hand while hosing with the other, LAME). A couple times, it came very close to falling on top of my pug, thank goodness he's still a pup and has quick reflexes. Not a pet-friendly feature for a pet vacuum. An easy fix would be if the hose was designed to come out of the side or front versus the back.I think it's probably better to spend a bit more money on a machine that will last; it will save you money in the long run."

We have two dogs, and the other vacuum just couldn't pick up all of the hair off the carpet.  The first time we used the Bissell, I was STUNNED at how much hair, dirt, dust and fuzz came up off of the carpet.  We had a half-full container just from the living room alone, and this is after vacuuming every few days normally.  Amazing!  I can't fault normal wear and tear on this unit as being a down-side.  We use the heck out of it, and with three kiddos and two dogs, it's on a nearly daily basis.  A few things have broken over time, like the plastic clips that hold the hose up and one of the power cord wraps as well, but that's about it.  It runs strong, works very well, and we will be buying another one here shortly.  Our middle child tipped over the vaccum from the upright position and it snapped a plastic piece on the bottom where the release lever is, so it doesn't stay upright like it should.Only downside is the beater brush doesn't stop running, ever.  It's always spinning, and if you lay the vacuum down while using the hose attachment, it exposes the spinning brush, which inevitably attracts little fingers.  My daughter got a brush burn on her finger from it, but it was my fault for not paying attention.Anyway, good vacuum for the money!"

Upon closer inspection I noticed the belt was broken so I purchased a new one and installed it. After just few minutes the new belt broke.I called the store where I purchased it but I couldn't return it because I no longer had the receipt. (note to self, keep receipts) So I called bissell and they said I must have installed the belt incorrectly or something got caught in it! Installing a belt is not brain surgery, it only goes in one way.I took it to my local vacuume repair shop and it cost over $100 to repair. The repairman pointed out where the belt had melted both the bottom and top of the plastic plates that hold the belt in place, chewing up the edges. That's why the second belt broke, the chewed up edges cut it as it spun around. He said he sees a lot of this model of Bissell with the same issue. The belts are not installed correctly at the factory!!!!I will never purchase another Bissell, if they aren't going to stand behind their product why should I?"

First it began to accumulate dirt at the top of reservoir, then it completely stop sucking stuff. But I found both short and long term solutions to this problem if you have the same machine:First, short term solution: If your machine has performance problems, what you should do now is to dissemble all the hoses and check inside of them (There is one screw that you have to deal with, prepare your screw driver). Dirt has already accumulated there, as a result it can not suck anything. Especially the long wobbly hose accumulates things a lot. The mini hose connected to bottom also accumulates dirt. Also check two plastic hoses you just dissembled . One of these plastic hoses (the one connected to wobbly one) accumulates dirt as well. Clean all of these, clean the filters, and you'll see machine operating again.Good news is that, after this initial operation there is a way of making the vacuum function and not letting dirt accumulate in hoses or at the top of reservoir. Remember if you see dirt stucking at the top of reservoir, there is something wrong and you have to do the procedure I have defined in second paragraph.For long term maintenance here is the trick you should do: You have to wash small foam air filter (that is in the drawer at the bottom of dirt cup). I am not talking about the hepa filter on side, beware. You have to clean that foam filter (it is thankfully very easy to clean, just wash it) every two-three uses of machine. If you don't clean it, machine will operate, but there will be no air circulation or no cyclone in the reservoir, and as a result dirt will accumulate first at the top of reservoir as I've described it, then in hoses and machine will stop sucking things. You need air movement in the reservoir to avoid accumulation of dirt at the top and in hosesI know, this is a very bad and weak design, but that is how it operates."

And times being what they are, my latest replacement had to be in a lower price range than previously. So I researched, chose a machine on sale for about 100 dollars more than this one, then decided the funds weren't there, and went for the bargain.When buying a vacuum cleaner, it's important to consider how often you use it, how much you mind fussing with filters, collection containers and attachments, and also what floors you're most using it on. Some cleaners work better on certain types of floors. If price is no object, you can choose a model based on very specific needs and desires. But at this price range, what you should expect is mainly good suction, reasonable durability, and smooth operation. This model seems to cover all three points so far. I like that there are many floor level settings, the way it rolls, and the length of the cord. I don't mind emptying the canister; I like it much better than old bag style cleaners, partly because I can see my progress as I work.Because my very cheap interim cleaner was not good at picking up dog hair, my first few outings with this one meant stopping to empty the collection container after each room. It was upsetting to realize how much I'd been missing lately, but gratifying to see it emptied into the garbage can. At the end of the cleaning tour, I rinsed out the container, checked the sponge filter, and was satisfied with the day's progress. Each time I've used it since then, there's been less hair than before. The pet eraser tool works fine on one of my two large area rugs, but less so on the other one. I think it needs a real steam cleaning at this point, to be honest.I haven't had any problems keeping the attachments in place, I like the strap that came with it to use with the lift out canister, and the floor attachment is very useful. For the money, I'd say it's a fine value. It may not have the gravitas of a 400+ dollar machine, but I wouldn't expect it to. I got what I paid for; a decent, practical value that should last for awhile with proper care."

So you get out the screw drivers, take the hoses apart, fish down inside with sticks and wires to pull the dirt out by hand.And what comes out?  Golf balls?  Oranges?  No, just a little piddly pile of dirt and some rug-fluff even the cheapest vacuum could pull up - one would think.  The hoses are cheap plastic, come apart easily (I guess they knew we'd have to be able to take it apart each time and pull the dirt out ourselves).  And you don't have to do this after every few times - you have to do this after every ten minutes of vacuuming!

We knew we were demanding of our vacuums and immediately I sat down to research the best, praying I wouldn't have to shell out $500 for a Dyson. This is a point over which my husband and I fought repeatedly, as he was pro-Dyson and I was convinced I could find something comparable for less. As much as it pains me to say this, he was right.Both our parents purchased Dysons some three to five years ago and while my parents have had a few problems with wear and tear (probably what you get when you buy a refurbished unit), his parents are still singing high praises.For approximately the first month, this vacuum was fabulous. Everything I'd hoped for. With two fairly large dogs (a Rottweiler and a Rottweiler-Lab mix) the Battle of the Fuzz was very real and ongoing. Certainly there were major design flaws--namely the fact that I had to slap the heck out of the canister to get the fur and dust, always lodged around the filter at the top, to fall into the canister so I could remove and empty it.As time went on I became more and more disillusioned and I stopped asking my husband to vacuum or I'd hear a constantly muttered 'Should have gotten a Dyson' the entire time he pushed the vacuum around the room (fruitlessly), cursing as he went.The sponge filter in the side compartment quickly clogged and now requires washing every week if we are vacuuming more than once a day (necessary with such large dogs). We learned quickly not to sprinkle the baking soda-based carpet refresher because we'd find soda in the canister for the next six vacuum sessions.The addition of a third dog (a Tosa) was the death knell for the Bissel. It doesn't even try anymore. While the Tosa doesn't appear to shed all that much, apparently he was the straw that broke the Bissel's back because most days I feel I'm simply rearranging the dirt.This vacuum does not have the suction to really pull any sort of accumulated fur off the carpet and I shudder to think of how much dander has worked its way down to the carpet pad. In addition, I find that the dander and dead skin from the dogs frequently clumps up the 'intake,' which is nearly impossible to clean (SCRAPE) out considering the angle.Unless you own a Mexican Hairless or a Handbag Dog, don't even bother. When we move we'll be leaving this piece of junk on the curb. And to my husband's 'I-told-you-so' delight, our next vacuum will be a Dyson."

Wonderful, actually, and had I written this review then I am sure I would have given it five stars. However, after the first two weeks the problems began. I must admit, when deciding which vacuum to purchase I read many reviews, including the negative reviews for this vacuum, and did not heed them. I wish I had listened now. But having two indoor dogs (one of which sheds quite a bit) I thought this vacuum would be a good fit (I was wrong of course).After the first week the trouble started with all the dust, dirt, and dog hair the vacuum picked up being piled up at the very top of the vacuum's inside (where I'd have to take the front part of the vacuum apart and take out the top part to get it all out. This is very messy, and I thought this alone was bad enough -now I have to do this every time I use this vacuum (on the rare occassion this vacuum actually picks up anything).After the second week or so the tiny drawer on the bottom (I forget what these are called) started accumulating all the dust and dog hair, and the vacuum picked up nothing else besides what it could cram in this little drawer.Now, after about a month or so of owning it, this vacuum picks up nothing. It has lost all suction. when I turn the vacuum over the tube that is supposed to suck all the dog hair and dust up is crammed full of my yellow lab's hair mixed with dust. When I try to get it all out (again, extremely messy) it still doesn't pick up much at all. I have checked again and again for clogs and gotten them out again and again, and it still doesn't help this vacuum. It is ridiculous.My vacuum is perpetually on RED, which I have to tell you is the most annoying thing EVER. I have owned many vacuums in my life. And the Dirt Devil this vacuum replaced lasted me for almost 5 years and even at the end of it's life worked better than this piece of crap vacuum is today after only one month of use.Soooo, buyer beware. If you've read this review you've been warned. This is the most high maitenance vacuum I have ever used in my life. It has lasted in my house (with two dogs) for a total of one month and a week and a half.I will be getting a new vacuum soon, because even though I think it's ridiculous that I should have to pay for another vacuum so soon, I like having a clean house and a clean carpet.

Given that they both have the same hepa filters and the same design i opted for this vacuum instead of a newer model healthy homeA new vacuum was not in my budget- as i was not planning on breaking my 4 year old Bissell so cost was a consideration but i wanted something POWERFUL. Dyson was not an option as it is in my opinion prohibitively expensive- sorry but 600$ vacuum... um NO.So at first i looked at the new model healthy home and that is about 200$, this was pushing it so i decided to just look at other vacuums altogether. I ended up with the Shark - the purple one, the one with over 800 amazon reviews. I vacuumed once with it- put it back in the box and returned it. It lacks the suction and power that my old healthy home had- i expected for it to be amazing, not only for the reviews but also for the simple fact that 4 years had gone by since i last purchased a vacuum- i thought technology would improve- i mean like 5 more Iphones came out in that time frame.So then i went on the bissell website did a comparision and i see this awesome vacuum that with the current rebate is going to be 160$.  I ordered it- it has ALL the features my old Bissell had but appears to be a more compact upgraded version.I get it home put it together.This vacuum is narrower than my old healthy home- slightly more compact, weighs a bit less but IT IS A HEAVY VACUUM FOR MOST PEOPLE. This does not bother me at all- i love my vacuum to be POWERFUL and if that means it will be heavy and sturdy and built like a tank- fine by me.This thing sucks so good- it got SO MUCH cat hair out of my carpet. It was amazing. My carpet actually feels clean- the beater brush really fluffs up this old apartment carpet and makes it so good.Some improvements over the old model- the power brush attachment stays on better and does not fall off. The power brush on/off button and the power button are not located out of the way so you do not hit them by accident.The canister is no longer narrowed on top so stuff falls out easier.I love the wide 15inch path and the light, it is excellent for seeing the dirt and if you need to go over the area again.I have no complaints- maybe one- it is loud, but not any more loud than most vacuums i used. I dont think we will be entering the 'silent' and powerful vacuum era anytime soon so really this is not a complaint but more of a comment- it is a vacuum- it is loud.Anyhow- Overall- i highly recommend this powerful vacuum."

After reading over the 'troubleshooting' section of the manual and doing everything it suggests, I finally called Bissell's customer service number.  The woman I spoke with asked me if I had taken a broomstick and put it through the hoses to make sure it wasn't clogged.  I explained to her it was practically new, and how could it be clogged if it never picked anything up?  (Also, using a broomstick to unclog was not in the troubleshooting guide.

Why did I chose this model instead of the newer Healthy Home 16N53?  This PowerClean I found locally for $10 cheaper ($189) than on Amazon and honestly, there is not really a different between them unless someone really is paranoid about germs an allergies the other may, psychologically, make them feel better.We really liked our old vacuum and it lasted as long as its 5 warranty (2006-2011) before the on/off switch began to malfunction; it was a power horse. I loved it much better than the Hoover Windtunnel it had replaced. After looking at newer Hoovers and the Shark Navigator, this Bissell won out because I had become attached to features we need (for both carpet & hard floors) like the adjustable brush height and the ability to turn the brush on and off which the Shark Navigator does neither. Plus it has the rubber wheels which I have come to prefer. I also like having my tools on board and not in a bag (unlike the Shark). Our house is not small or cramped so the 15in wide aspect of this vacuum is great for open, roomy homes. This vacuum also comes with a lifetime belt, and the one on our 5 yr old Bissell never broke. I also wanted to stay bagless and away from Hoover's paper tube filters that do not clean well. Although we did notice that this newer model at first seemed, I hate to use the word, 'cheaper' because it doesn't seem as tough and durable as our older Bissell Healthy Home, it is also 7.5 lbs lighter. The old vac was 29.5 lbs and this one is 22. So I do like that this new one is lighter and it works just the same. It maneuvers fine and is easy to empty and clean, not to mention that it cleans all floors VERY well.Since manufacturers are dead set on making everything so cheap these days, I currently like to stay between $150-$200 on a vacuum and buy one every 5 years or so (as I don't ask more from a vacuum than for it to last at least as long as it's warranty which is 5 yrs in this case); I do however hope I can get this Bissell to last longer than it's 5 yr warranty. Bissell is running a rebate until mid October for $20 off all vacs over $100, so I sent that in which brought my total for this vac to $169. I am happy considering that the $475 Dyson that was sitting next to it on the shelf only had a 2 year warranty, per stated on the box. I will gladly take my chances with the Bissell again. :"

I've had this vacuum for several months, and each time I vacuum I'm astonished at how much cat hair it picks up. (I'm surprised the cat has any hair left--it seeems to all be in the Bissell.) The only problem I had with it was due to operator error. I couldn't make the roller brush work. Turns out there's a clearly marked button on the handle. Duh! I don't know when I'd ever operate it without the roller brush working, but if I ever choose to turn it off, there's a button. The filtration system also works great. I'm allergic to cats (love them anyway) and am so glad the dander and hair is sucked up with no dust being stirred up or exhaled into the room.This vacuum isn't the most maneuverable thing and it is heavy, if that matters to you.

I chose this specifically because of the HEPA filtration system, and it does not disappoint.Build-wise, it's very sturdy, and actually quite heavy. This doesn't bother me at all, but should be something you consider if that is a concern. Everything fits together snugly and securely, with the exception of the brush attachment on the back, which falls off on me all the time, and the extending arm that never seems to stay locked in place. It handles beautifully, and will turn off the bottom roller when you lock it on the upright position. One of my favorite features is that it also has a separate button to turn the roller off. The little brush attachment is a nice bonus, and works relatively well, though it doesn't pick up everything without doing several passes.The only major detractor from this vacuum is how often the filters need to be cleaned to maintain suction. It's a bit of a hassle, but it is better than having to replace them outright. It has a high quality feel, but without the high quality price.

We have a long haired dog who sheds a lot so we wanted a vacuum to pick up dog hair for sure.  We liked the initial construction when we looked at the vacuum in the store and after reading several pretty positive reviews we decided to try it.  We've had it now for a month, have used it extensively, and what a deal it turned out to be so far.The first thing we noticed about the vacuum is that it has outstanding suction and picks up everything compared to the much more expensive Electrolux!  We have mostly carpets and some tile and going from one to the other was a breeze.  We also have two sets of carpeted stairs that we use a lot and attachments with it worked great on those.  You do need to be sure to always reseat the hose firmly in its carrying position after using it so the vacuum suction is redirected to the floor rollers.  The amount of dog hair the vacuum picked up (that we thought our Electrolux was getting) was astounding.  Also it is very efficient at getting the fine stuff as well.  It is really remarkable how well it works on our carpets (short pile).  Because of the 'dirt' our previous vac had missed we ended up emptying the canister several times the first time we used it, and discovered how easy it was to do so.  We also like the fact that all of the accessories remain with the vacuum and out of the way.Our impression is the Bissell 16N54 is sturdy, easy to use and move around, and gets the job done for a reasonable price - what more can you ask for when buying a vacuum? Time will tell how well it lasts, but for now we couldn't be more pleased with this vacuum.Update 26 Dec 2011  We'd buy this again in a heartbeat - what a great piece of equipment.  This removes so much dog hair and dirt that one has to be careful to empty it frequently, but I'm not complaining.  Our carpets and floors have never been so clean.  We continue to be extremely pleased with this vacuum - it appears Bissell did things right with this one!Update 19 Dec 2012  This vacuum continues to amaze us.  We use it a lot with no problems at all.  We highly recommend."

The wheels that control the ride height of the brush head are too small, the roller brush has short, very stiff bristles and is driven by a separate motor that bogs down easily.  All this combines to make the Powerclean very sensitive to the density and pile height of the carpet.  If your home has several carpet types or rugs you need to vacuum then don't buy this model unless you enjoy constantly reaching down to adjust the carpet height setting.Ergonomics and handling aren't great either.  It's a bit hefty, the rubber rear wheels are a hindrance on carpet and the handle has to be lowered almost all the way to the floor to lift up the front end.On the plus side the dual stage cyclone system seems to do a good job capturing fine particles and dust which should keep HEPA filter changes to a minimum.  Overall build quality seems pretty good, the dirt canister assembly appears to stay well sealed.  The accessory hose and power cord are fairly long but not so long as to be a nuisance.  The ability to turn off the roller brush is nice bit it appears to come at a price.A word about 'suction'.  This model can develop relatively high vacuum pressure at zero flow.  That's good for lifting bowling balls (Oreck commercial) and seems impressive when you stick the accessory hose against your hand, but it's not what cleans carpets.  To pull the dirt from the floor and into the vacuum cleaner you need air flow and the more air you move the harder it is to maintain vacuum pressure.  Without going into an overly detailed explanation of how vacuum cleaners work, it should suffice to say that under typical operating conditions, this Bissell has about as much 'suction' as my old $70 Hoover with a fresh bag.  It's adequate, but not astonishing.  To be fair I should note that my old Hoover doesn't provide anything near the level of filtration that the Bissell does."

To clear the jam I either have to remove the screws holding the plastic tube together to the vacuum (the back half of the tube is molded into the canister part of the vacuum, or fold up strapping tape and try to ease it down the tube over and over again, gradually pulling out little bits of the jam.

This isn't a $400 Dyson, and it isn't a 20 year old Dirt Devil, which is what it replaced. Other reviewers are right--it spits dust back out if the filters are not seated properly. Unfortunately, they are difficult to seat properly and I don't think it was designed well for the HEPA filter to actually seal. My won't and it is brand new. It recommends cleaning the foam filter EVERY use. I don't, it works fine. It also recommends replacing the HEPA more often than I do. That said, it really isn't a great vacuum. It has plenty of suction power, it keeps your floors and rugs pretty clean. It pics up much more dust than it spits back out. You don't notice the dust coming back out, but it is there as the outside of the vacuum is always dust covered right hear the air discharge. Remember, you get what you pay for. I was tired of the old Dirt Devil and it used bags. Interestingly, it kept things cleaner, since the bags didn't leak. But bags are getting far too expensive as it was an old vacuum. So this one paid for itself by not having bags. I'm happy enough with it, as I have mostly hardwoods and use this for throw rugs, stairs, and even the wood floors. It makes them clean enough for us. It does require emptying the cup 4 or 5 times per full house clean due to the small cup and our dog with lots of hair. Also, the small holes of the inner workings of the cyclonic action appear to clog after a while, so you have to brush it out or bang it against the edge of a trash can to clear them every so often. If you have bad allergies, or have all carpet, this is likely not the vacuum for you. Spend the extra for something that works better. Worth $80? Not likely, honestly. Maybe $50. Certainly not $100, which was the sticker price (non-sale) at Target."

I won't complain about the suction, it's good enough and better than the last light weight Dirt Devil I bought, and I won't complain about the noise - I could care less how noisy it is, I want it to clean.  What I will complain about is two things - one, the 'carpet level adjuster' just spins without adjusting anything.  I turned it upside down and examined it and it just doesn't come anywhere close to the wheel assembly - poorly manufactured.  Second, I thought the handle would remove easily to use the tools but you have to remove the hose at the bottom and attach it to the handle tube anyway so what's the difference?  With my $40 DD I had to remove the hose to attach it to the tools, I'm no better off.  In fact I'm worse off because with the bagged vacuums, you only change the bag once every two months or so, with the bagels vacuums, you have to clean it out after every use.  What's the commotion over bagless vacuums??!  When I took my last Hoover in to be fixed after one month I was told (by a Hoover rep no less) 'Don't buy expensive vacuums, they're all garbage - buy a cheap one and use it till it breaks.'

I don't notice any dust blowing around or any obnoxious odor if I put all the filters back after cleaning and properly seating the removeable debris holder. If those components aren't installed correctly then dust blowing can occur. It isn't hard to push around and my wife and I are in our mid 70's (yes, I am a male vacuumer). Homework also reveals the weight so no problem there either. Other than normal wear the belts last as long as comparable vacuums. Of course if I mis-use it then they won't.

Throughout the course of vacuuming my living room alone I got my leg shocked 3x and my hand once!  I'm returning it because I really don't like the feeling of being shocked every 15 seconds.  However, I really enjoyed everything else about the vacuum.  It's a real shame."

In addition, this vacuum lists (in a very readable font) all the replaceable part numbers (filter and belt) as well as cleaning instructions (for filter replacement and container cleanup).While this vacuum did a good job with cleaning, my biggest problem was cleaning the vacuum itself - which can be agony for allergy sufferers. This is also the reason for my 3-star rating.The contents of the container, a super-fine chalk like powder, take to the air very easily. The vacuum does simplify this process with a single lever that not only pops open the bottom, but also sets off a little dust cloud. Next, the dismantling of the air director (a vertical shaft within the container) can be a challenge - as it needs to be dusted off and wiped down with a damp cloth. Finally, you have to deal with the HEPA and foam filters which can also get really clogged up with this very fine dust - much more so than with bagged vacuums. If this weren't an issue, the UD40275 would have rated much higher in my book.Happy Vacuuming!~Damodar"

I ran over the cord and it wasn't as pretty as some others, but it worked.A friend bought me this Dirt Devil to replace it and initially it was powerful and seemed like a great deal. But here are the problems that have developed in a few short weeks:--The canister FALLS off when you pick up the vacuum and move it around, like when you're trying to drag it up the stairs. This has happened so often that I started cussing out the vacuum.--The power brush also falls off when in use.--The suction isn't working anymore through the hose, so the vacuum is only good using the main, bottom part. The power brush doesn't work because there's no suction. It definitely doesn't suck. ;)--The plastic parts are so cheap that they break off easily. The pieces for the cord wrap-around are ready to break off and the place where the power brush click on also broke off.

I received this vacuum in the Dirt Devil box without and outer box to protect it. The box got smashed from the travel to my house, but thankfully everything was in the box that should have been. I was surprised by the plastic parts and how cheap the vacuum looked. I thought for sure this vacuum was going back. **IMPORTANT**--You need to look on the handle for the bag with the screws to put it together. They are in a red bag tied around the red handle and it blends together so you cannot see it well. I drove myself crazy looking for them! I put it together quickly. It did not seem like the canister fit tightly over the filter area because there was a little gap, but it is correct. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by the suction power of this vacuum! Very powerful! It picked up things that my old vacuum did not pick up. Now I've had the vacuum for about 3 weeks and the belt broke. I noticed I had a string from a runner rug wrapped around the roller. So you need to make sure that you do not pick up any long strings or anything that can wrap around the roller. Aside from that, it's a nice lightweight vacuum with very good suction power!"

The front of the base is too light. It does not hold to the floor when operating  the vacuum backwards, making it impossible to do the standard 'Z' pattern  of back-and-forth sweeping motion, where you somewhat overlap each pass.  (When you pull it backwards, the front lifts up just enough to stop picking up dirt.)  This equates to more effort (and frustration) to accomplish the same task as other vacs. . It picked up roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of the amount of dirt that previous vacuums did  over the same floor areas (given the same period of time between clearings).  It just did not pick up as much as anything prior to it. . The power on switch began to fail after 1 month.  You would have to fiddle with it to get it to turn on. . The handle release switch did not release the handle with one hand (or foot) press.  Again -- this is likely because the front of the base is too light.  Think about how you would handle this. One hand is holding the handle already and  a foot or hand has to press the handle switch. If another foot or hand is needed to  hold down the front of the base to release the handle -- It's like playing a game of  twister just to release the handle.  sigh.Pros . (I'm trying to come up with one.)  I want to say cost, but for $20-more I've had dramatically better vacs.  Sorry -- I saw little redeeming value in this vacuum.May your experience be better than mine(but I would suggest a different vacuum choice)."

The initial set-up was easy. This new vacuum does its work better than the old one (which was a bagged and for carpet only). I was satisfied after the first use on hardwood floor and carpet. That's one of the primary reasons I bought it! It works for hardwood floor and carpet. I no longer need to have two vacuums.The vacuum's suction was strong enough that it 'grabbed' a t-shirt while I was vacuuming the hardwood floor. Probably, since it's still new. After initial use, the cup was half-full already! The bagless dirt cup was easy to remove. However, the lid cannot be opened all the way to the side so that the dirt can smoothly fall out of the cup. Also, the sound coming out of this vacuum, as in others generally, may be irritating after using it for a while.So far, I like this vacuum! I think it is worth the price."

She's been through an expensive Dyson, a pricy Bissel and a stick vac. So when this Dirt Devil arrived I put it together (two screws and 10 minutes) and waited for cleaning day. I felt a little like a Roman centurion sending prisoner to the lions, but I told her where it was. She vacuumed the whole house with the Dirt Devil UD40275 Power Path Dual Stage Cyclonic Bagless Upright and it did a great job. I took the wheel several times and found it to be just the right weight (not to heavy to move, not to light to hold the corners). I wouldn't say it was quiet, but what vacuum is. It picked up the dirt and cat hair as well as our more expensive machines. It is easy to empty, easy to carry and doesn't take up much space in the hall closet.

The first one I purchased at Walmart for around $45 or so some 5 years ago. Oh, it's still running, I simply wore it out. It's been relegated to garage duty - sort of a forced retirement. LOLLike most of us, I did a fair amount of research into vacuums.  My criterion was that I didn't want to spend a lot of cash, less that $100, but at the same time, I didn't want a piece of junk either. Not having a vacuum of another brand for a long time really doesn't give me the right to compare it with anything else out there - except to my previous Dirt Devil.The price was right, less than $100. It had the features I was looking for and a brand name that I did have some experience with. When I read these reviews, I always tell myself that we're human, with different tastes, needs and the like. You will always find someone who finds something offensive about a product which you find perfectly acceptable. With that in mind, here goes...The Dirt Devil came in a fairly small carton, which unfortunately, had a dent which pierced the cardboard.  I'm always anxious when I get something like this but thank goodness the vacuum was safe and sound. I wish Amazon would put the original carton into one of theirs (sometimes they do this) so as to give the packaging a little more strength and also hide what's inside. This vacuum was 'sold by Amazon'.  My overall experience with Amazon has been five-stars!I proceeded to unpack the vacuum, all the parts were there. You should note that the two (2) screws needed for assembly are taped to the handle in a red, plastic envelope.  The vacuum is red. I bring this up only because I missed them at first. You guessed it.  Panic! Where are the screws?The vacuum goes together quickly. Like I said, two (2) screws secure the two pieces of the handle to the part which houses the rotating brush, which has a light  The handle is sort of a loop rather than a traditional handle that you have to grip. This makes the vacuum easy to move around and it won't slip out of your hand.  It's a light vacuum but it has a good deal of power.  My carpet is 6 years old and is a low-pile.  It did pick up a lot of stuff that the old one was missing.  I found that it glided nice and smooth across the carpet. There are four (4) carpet-height settings and one for bare floors.The dirt container is really simple to detach from the machine and empty. Unlike other vacuums, the filter is not in the dirt container but underneath it. When the dirt container is removed, you can easily remove the filter to inspect/clean it as necessary. I've already cleaned the filter and the foam element that sits on top of it just by running it under water and it cleaned up nicely.  You just need to wait for it to dry so do this at the end of your vacuuming chores and it will be ready for the next use.The power cord for my use is long enough.  My house is small, 1400 sqft (ranch, so no stairs) so I don't need to plug/unplug too many times.  I think the shorter cord is a good idea.  My last Dirt Devil had a really long cord but it used to get really warm and the plug itself got hot as well.  This cord is barely warm.  There is no auto-cord windup but I didn't see that an issue for me.The usual attachments are there and have slots on the vacuum for storage. The small power-hand tool has a decent amount of power to clean upholstery, car mats, whatever.Switches:  The power-switch is foot-activated on the side of the vacuum.. Also located close-by is the pedal to tilt the handle backwards for vacuuming.  If you don't cut the power to the vacuum while it is in the upright position, the brush will continue to run.  This might damage your carpet if left there too long.Overall construction of the vacuum is satisfactory.  Of course it's plastic but it seems durable - only time will tell. Also, the vacuum's exhaust blows out the sides and not on to the carpet which could blow dirt around.I'm happy with the vacuum. I have a minor Asthma problem so I vacuum regularly.So far so good.  One more thing, I don't have any pets.  I'm sure that makes a big difference in the performance of a vacuum."

I do not like the cheap plastic feel of it, but it does work pretty well on both carpet and hard floors.  I sprinkled some shredded paper on my carpet to see how the vacuum would handle picking it up along with the other trash and dust that was on the floor and to my surprise it had very little problem picking it up.  I didn't experience any jams, loss of suction or having to run over the same area twice to pick up trash.  It also seems to be able to pick up a lot of unseen dust and dirt as evident in the see through container.  It also has convenient attachments/detachments that will allow you to vacuum hard to reach areas such as stairs, car floors and seats.  It is lightweight and easy to maneuver.On the hard wood floors in my home, the vacuum also does very well.  From past experience, vacuums have never done well on hard surfaces as it would just blow stuff around instead of picking it up.  This vacuum however, surprised me.  After setting the vacuum height to the lowest level (2nd lowest for larger pieces of trash), I was able to pick up those annoying shreds of paper and other small pieces of trash that always seem to be showing up either from outside or tracked in the area from other areas of my home.  Unlike the carpet however, there were a few instances in which I had to go over an area more than once in order to pick it up.  Also I noticed that on occasion turning the vacuum off over an area where I recently picked up trash that trash would be spit back on the floor.  However, a quick re-vacuum of that area would easily pick up the spit out trash and simply going over a clean area before turning the vacuum off should help you to avoid this problem.  Though its quicker than sweeping, I still wouldn't recommend using this vacuum to completely replace sweeping on your hard surfaces.  It is however good if you just need to quickly get annoying pieces of small trash and loose dirt off the floor without having to break out the broom and dust pan every single time.My only other complaint is that the bag-less compartment doesn't ever seem to go back in right after emptying and there is an ugly gap between the bottom of it and the vacuum itself.  It seems like its going to fall out but I suppose the seal is good because nothing blows out of the gap while vacuuming.Overall I'm happy with this vacuum and it has already replaced my older vacuum that is only a vacuum by mere definition.  Other than the cheap feel and the iffy bag-less container it does a nice job.Update 12/14/2012:After using this vacuum for a few months, I have noticed that there seems to be a permanent loss of suction.  When I first noticed the indicator on the front of the vacuum being red, I thoroughly cleaned out the filter and tried again.  While the indicator wasn't completely red, it was about 60% red meaning that there is still is a significant loss of suction.  I've taken the vacuum apart made sure all the hoses were clear of obstruction in addition to cleaning the filter, but no luck whatsoever.  Oh well it was a good vacuum while it lasted, but like just about any other vacuum it becomes useless after a while."

I needed a vacuum that can handle dirt, pet hair, cat litter, wood chips, and the occasionally stray piece of hay.I decided not to vacuum until this arrived to see if it could really perform and it did.

Then a few months passed and it started eating belts.  I JUST replaced the belt about five minutes ago and it's already broken!  Not to mention the vacuum has lost much of its sucking power.  I would stick with something that will last a little longer and wouldn't purchase this one again."
"1300","XX","B003OAD24Y","4.0","October 20, 2011","A30IP3E4MDQ36","It sucks... but in a good way","I gave this vacuum a good long workout for the last few weeks to see how it performs and to my surprise it's taken it all in stride.First off is the assembly. You'll need a screwdriver and that's it. Two screws and a few 'snaps' and it's put together and ready to go. While putting it together I noticed that the majority of the vacuum is plastic, compared to our older Royal which is like 99% metal, it feels extremely cheap and like it's about to break.Placement of the power cord down low became a hassle. If the power cord was routed through or close to the handle, it would keep the cord from getting in the way while vacuuming.The other issue I had was the foot power button. If or when it grabs ahold of some curtains, blind strings, or even a rug, it takes a lot longer to hit the on/off button with your foot than it is to flip a switch or push a button that is located closer to the handle. This was found out when it grabbed ahold of a blanket and it took me a good three or four seconds to turn off the machine, which caused the belt to get a bit burnt and smell up the living room a bit. Again compared to the older Royal vac, when it grabs ahold of something by accident you can almost immediately switch it off.Adjustment of the brush head (high pile to low pile) has to be done with your hand, so adjusting it on the fly is not an option. A foot operated pile adjustment would be better.Emptying it and cleaning it is fairly simple and doesn't take a whole lot of effort. Removing the brush head to clean/remove hair that gets wrapped around it can be done by unscrewing three screws and a bit of elbow grease. One thing I noticed is that the vacuum as a whole collects and retains a lot of fine dust in nooks and crannies. Also a LOT of static electricity builds up and everything sticks to it.Now I will say I started off hating this vacuum for all of the flaws I listed above, especially the flimsiness of it... but it has performed extremely well.Suction power is phonemail! Once the container starts to get filled up it's power starts to diminish a little bit, but a quick dump of the container and all of the power returns.The onboard hose attachment is quite nice. You can be vacuuming and pop that sucker right off, put on the nozzle and get the baseboard and other nooks and crannies vacuumed all without missing a beat.With all of the minor flaws and issues I had with this vacuum, the fact that it has so much sucking power and doesn't blow dust and dirt everywhere (because of the filter) TOTALLY outweighs the issues I have with it.So if you are looking for a new vacuum and don't want to break the bank, this Dirt Devil UD40275 Power Path Cyclonic Bagless Upright is definitely an awesome choice, especially for under $80!"

Just used it once, and it seems to pick up trash on the bare floors better, but it's cumbersome and makes my arm tired.  If I decide to keep it, I may do one room a day. Also, much louder than the Eureka, which could mean the motor's more powerful? I don't know, but they're both 12 amp vacuum cleaners.Probably if I want the perfect vacuum cleaner, I'll have to go up considerably in price, and I wouldn't mind if I knew one that was truly better. Actually, I miss my old Eureka vac with disposable bag.  Yes, I guess it's being lazy, and not eco-minded, but it's soooo  much easier, and cleaner just to throw away the old bag and stick in a new one.  Technology sometime leaves me.....in the dust."

"1306","XX","B003OAD24Y","5.0","September 29, 2011","A2FRKEXDXDN1KI","For it's price and what this vacuum accomplishes...it's definitely worth it!","First and foremost, let me just say that I'm a Dyson vacuum user and have one that I feel is a good investment and still going strong after 8 years.But my review is not for a Dyson but a Dirt Devil UD40275 Power Path Dual Stage Cyclonic Bagless Upright vacuum.  I have to admit that I was curious to see how far cyclonic vacuums have come from companies like Dirt Devil (which is a reputable company that has been around for a long time).I.  SETUPThe vacuum was delivered and it came in segments. The instructions mentioned to insert two screws and at first we thought we were missing the screws until we realized that the tape around the handle held the two screws.  Once we figured that out, assembly for this vacuum was easy.This vacuum has a lot of attachments, extension arm and definitely much lighter than my Dyson DC 14.II.  THE TESTWe have a child and two dogs, and the three have given our vacuums an extreme workout.  We know what our Dyson can do and we know how other vacuums have done and have literally broke down.  So, let's give the Dirt Devil a try!And surprise...surprise!  This vacuum literally sucked the carpet of all the dirt and dog hair and whatever is in there into its compartment.  I was quite impressed, it did as well as my Dyson and it costs far less!And as mentioned, there are many attachments, it's light and for the most part, it did its job!III.  JUDGMENT CALLNow, I know there are many out there looking for a vacuum and for me, I bought the Dyson because I have had high failure rates with other vacuums.  They kept breaking down, overheating or had some sort of part breaking.  So, I invested in the Dyson for its reputation and as mentioned, it has worked well and not lost suction for eight years.BUT... that vacuum cost me around $500+ at the time.  Here we are with a Dirt Devil UD40275 that did a fantastic job of collecting dirt, dog hair and everything that was in the carpet.  I was impressed!  For $80, a lot of attachments, really solid extension and most importantly, magnificent performance...the Dirt Devil did just as good as my Dyson.BUT (#2)... As mentioned, my Dyson lasted me eight years and still going strong.  Will the Dirt Devil UD40275 last as long?  Will it lose suction each year? I guess time will tell and I can easily come back and update my review to let you know.  But I suppose at $80 and if you get several years out of it, you can easily upgrade to the next best thing years later.  Whereas in a Dyson, if it broke down early for the price I paid for it, I would be very upset!So, this is my feeling towards the Dirt Devil UD40275.For it's price, this is a fantastic vacuum.  It performed as strongly as my Dyson when I first bought it (and even now).  You're getting a lot of bang for your buck with this vacuum cleaner and because it is cyclonic, it picks up a lot of dirt, hair, etc. and it's easy to dispose of as well.  No bags, no rubber band belt that snap in the bottom...this is a solid cyclonic, bagless vacuum.Will it last you a decade?  Who knows.  But probably at this price...if it lasts you for 3-5 years...you can easily upgrade to the latest and new version of a Dirt Devil.  This is a vacuum that works within a budget and performs just as well as an expensive cyclonic vacuum cleaner.But for under $80 and for its performance, it's hard to beat.The Dirt Devil UD40275 is highly recommended!"

I am still using it and really like it. They both have a 12 amp motor. The Sears is 22.4 lbs and the Dirt Devil 19.3 but I did not notice a difference other than the Sears did not tip over as easily. I used the wand on stairs and found it a little harder to use than the Sears. My Sears has a disconnect to prevent the beaters from turning while using the wand which is shaped a little different.  My Sears had an optional add-on hose that allows me to park the vacuum at the top of the stairs and use the wand all the way down the staircase. I still give the Dirt Devil 5 stars for its superior carpet cleaning. It pulled up human hair and dust that had gotten to the bottom of the strands. I did not expect such a superior job from an inexpensive vacuum. I suspect that the bag-less design permits more airflow than my bag vacuum.Emptying the unit is easy. I suggest that you practice the removal and release and take out the filters before using it the first time. That will make it much cleaner and easier for when you have completed your first vacuuming. When I first read that you should empty the unit after each vacuuming, I thought-How is this an improvement over bags which last for several cleanings? But after emptying the Dirt Devil the first time, I thought- This is really easy."

The Dirt Devil is one powerful vacuum - it did a halfway decent job picking up dust as opposed to the swiffer, but over the rugs is where the vacuum shined. I was flat out astonished as to how much dirt and junk that the vacuum picked up. In comparison to my original 10+ year old bagged vacuum, this was picking up a lot more dirt. The assembly is rather easy - there are two screws to hold the handle in place that are really needed to keep the vacuum from falling apart.A few caveats: I really didn't read through the instruction manual as to how to empty the compartment, I managed to dump a decent amount of it on the floor, so please read the instruction manual. It also The vacuum also feels a bit flimsy so if I had to bring this up or down stairs it might fall apart.Overall, I'm happy with this vacuum. It's really powerful to the point that I was impressed at what ended up in the vacuum. The nozzle attachment helped me get to tight spots and was long enough that I didn't feel like I had to play tug-of-war with the vacuum. If you're an urbanite like me looking for your first vacuum purchase, you can't go wrong with this amazing Dirt Devil vacuum."
"1310","XX","B003OAD24Y","4.0","August 13, 2011","A2RCRFKO9NSS9S","Good Value for the Buck","Previous vacuums (Eureka, Hoover, and Dirt Devil) I have purchased in the past were packed with the vacuum in its full upright position.  I was surprised to receive this vacuum in a square box.  My initial thought was they shipped the base with some parts and the remaining contents would arrive in a separate box.  However, when I opened the box all pieces were inside.  Some assembly is required so a small flat head or phillips screwdriver is needed for a two-screw assembly.  The assembly would not have taken too long had the written instructions and diagrams were clearer.  This is my one knock on this purchase -- the instruction booklet.  So I ditched the instructions and figured out the assembly myself.  I've only used the vacuum twice in the past week of ownership, but was pleasantly surprised how much cleaner all my rugs are.  The attachments are on-board so cleaning floor, rugs, and area rugs were effortless. While using this Dirt Devil I took to the new handle (my 2nd generation Dirt Devil had a standard handle), noticed how light weight it was, liked how flat it lays to get under tables and chairs, and enjoyed the easy release function of the dirt canister.  Also, the HEPA filter is in a better location for filtration purposes, and it was a snap to clean after use.  For the cost, this vacuum cleaner seems to be a good value.  If this one lasts and performs as well and as long as my prior Dirt Devil, then I'll know I truly bought good value."

Out of excitement of receiving this dirt devil I wanted to give it a try. Within only half the room the canister was full! I was in shock! Ever since then I am using it all the time.Pros: Deep cleans, great long attachments, bag-less, easy assemble.Cons: Bag compartment fills fast, small leak of dust around bag less compartment, although it has a floor level change on front, I see no difference.Great for apartments, and first vacuum owners!"

My aunt owns two smaller Dirt Devil uprights, and being impressed with the quality of those units, I decided to purchase this larger unit to replace my old Hoover upright.  I had no idea that my old vacuum was leaving the dirt behind that it was, but each week when I vacuum now, the dirt it is extracting is unbelievable.  It must still be pulling old cat fur and debris left behind for years from my old vacuum cleaner.The only minus in my review would be for the 'Power Brush' attachment, which I was hoping would be a great tool in removing my cat's fur from the upholstery.  It is fairly useless, clogging almost immediately with just a small amount of fur in it, the tool must be disassembled to remove the fur from the brush, then it will clog again as soon as it get a little more fur in it.  I just continue to use my Pledge Fabric Sweeper to get the fur off my upholstery.I love this product and highly recommend it for floor cleaning.  However, if the 'Power Brush' attachment is that important to you for pet fur removal from upholstery, you will not be happy in purchasing it."

Power tool attachment is a problem though.","A friend purchased this vacuum for me from Amazon to replace an old, bagged, Dirt Devil.  It does an excellent job on the carpet, particularly with cleaning up fur from my cat.  However, the power brush attachment which is purported to be great for cleaning upholstery, curtains, etc leaves a LOT to be desired.  The brush is turned via the vacuum's suction, but it will stop rotating almost immediately after you hold it down on the surface to be cleaned.  When trying to clean up cat hair, the fur beomes readily entangled around the brush, subsequently causing it cease turning.You have to keep repeatedly opening the brush casing up to pull out the hair strands.  Unfortunately, after using this power brush just 3 times, it will no longer turn sufficiently fast to do ANYTHING now, despite having removed all the cat hair entangled in it.  As a result, I now have to go back to using the regular bristle brush attachment to try and clean up my cat's hair...which is a tedious process...having to pull the brush along a surface a few times, then pick the fur off and drop it in the hose to be drawn into the cannister.Overall, I give the vacuum a 4-star rating."

"1316","XX","B003OAD24Y","4.0","February 14, 2011","A31CQFT7PL70Z8","Very Powerful But With a Quirk","I bought this to replace a cheap bagless vacuum cleaner I'd bought several years ago during a Black Friday sale. Said vacuum didn't pick up dirt very well, clogged easily (both the hose to the dirt compartment and the area around the 'filter' at the top of the compartment). It also didn't have a hose. However, until I used this Dirt Devil on my carpet, I had no idea just how bad it was.This vacuum picks up dirt better than the last bagged vacuum I owned. I learned this in an unfortunate way; skipping over the instructions on how to empty it, I ended up dumping the contents partly on my hand. Those contents were a very thin, almost rice-like powder, nothing like what my previous vacuums had picked up. Best of all, when I ran it over some loose cat litter, it didn't spit anything back out at me like many vacuums. The hose is generous with several nifty attachments (I haven't used them all but soon will) and the sucking power is strong enough to yank my hands towards the hose. But be careful when you first remove the vacuum from the styrofoam packing; I was repeatedly shocked when I vacuumed my floor, and badly. I recommend running a dryer sheet over the hose before using it the first time (unless you let it sit out for a while).Speaking of the bagless compartment, it has easy removal to empty and the bottom-opening method is rather clever once you know it's there. The HEPA and foam filter are also very easy to get to (pop open the catch once you've removed the collecting compartment, and voila!). It's also about double the size of my old one. I vacuumed a mid-size living room and it was only 75% full (I have a Maine Coon cat, so most of it was fur). The old vacuum had to be emptied halfway through most of the time.However, there are a few minor problems with this vacuum. The box suggests it can be used on bare floor, but it merely blew a small area of dirt all over the kitchen. But I'll not quibble over that since vacuums are meant for carpets anyway. The biggest complaint I have is that the collecting container falls out. It has yet to fall out during use, thankfully, but you should've heard me scream when it first fell out as I was putting it away. This was before I realized that the container is utterly sealed. No mess to clean up if it tips over (though at the time, I believe it was already empty - call it a habit from the old vacuum that had repeated spills). It seems to come loose if you set it down too hard. It's fairly secure when simply moving the vacuum back and forth, or even shaking the handle. It's a vertical jarring that does it.This vacuum is quite heavy, so I'm not sure it'd be good for taking up and down stairs. But the heaviness is all in the bottom of the vacuum, and helps push the vacuum onto the carpet. So it's a trade-off. I can't tell you if there's any extra oomph to be had by the cyclonic airflow. I did notice the cat hair was more evenly distributed rather than clumping in one spot and restricting the flow. There's also quite a bit of exhaust air, but I didn't notice it having as bad a dusty/dirty quality to it as most vacuums, so perhaps the HEPA filter matters. Lastly, I'm 5'9 and most vacuums tend to have me stooping slightly, but this one seemed to be tall enough for me. Personally, I'm pretty happy with the Dirt Devil UD40275, flaws and all. Good value for the price."
"1317","XX","B000REMVGK","4.0","January 22, 2013","A19381LJBGW08L","Great Vacuum - Been Using for 4 Years!","I bought this vacuum from Menards for $225 over four years ago. I love it! I am a little bit of a clean freak and vacuum a 2200 square foot house (all mostly carpet) 1 to 2 times per week. This vacuum works great. It has great suction and I like the attachments it offers. I espcially like the power hand tool which is great for vacumming carpeted stairs and furniture. I empty the canister every time I vacuum and, yes, it is messy. But it's bagless and I think all bagless vacuums are messy; it does save you from spending money to replace the bags though. That is one reason I switched from a bagged vacuum to this one. I've been reading other reviews stating that this vacuum no longer sucks and the powered hand tool no longer spins. Well, if you don't clean the filters every three months as recommended in the manual, of course it won't have good suction. And, poor suction is what causes the powered hand tool to not spin. As long as you take out the filter at the top of the canister and clean it well (I use my husband's shop vac and vacuum the filter and then wash it in the kitchen sink with water and let it air dry before reinstalling). Also, probably about once a year, my husband takes the canister apart and the base spinning brush section apart and blows it out with his air compressor. Yes, this can be a pain, but it makes the vacuum operate as if it was brand new. I have had to replace the belt and just recently the hose that connects the base to the hand held removable hose on this unit. I also opted to order a new HEPA filter for it while ordering the hose. Please note, this only cost me about $25 from a vacuum parts warehouse (search online), and I think it is to be expected when the vacuum has been used over 250 times in the last four years. The replacement for these parts was a little difficult (except for the HEPA filter, it just slides in and out), but it was worth the extra 30 minutes to an hour to replace these things and much cheaper than replacing a perfecting operational vacuum. Before purchasing this vacuum, I researched a lot of vacuums. I even considered buying a Dyson, but when it came down to it, I didn't think it was work the extra $200. I am happy with this vacuum and would definitely recommend it if you don't mind doing a little maintenance and taking care of your vacuum. I don't think any vacuum would be maintenace free. I hope my review has helped you."

FYI: this is NOT say the motor, suctions and functions haven't declined - which they definitely have. This is basically when plugged in and powered on = the motor still turns over, electrical connection, etc.- It does pick up a lot of dirt, dust, and other stuff deemed dirty.- Has carpet and bare floor settings.- Retractable cord.CONS:- The bagless aspect of this appliance is difficult to remove and replace, which is often since it does do a good job of picking up all the dirt.- The bagless feature is horrible and tend emits a dust 'wind-tunnel' all of its own accord, meaning that the dirt seems to escape through the cracks or something of the bagless container while in use, creating a layer of dirty residue on the outside of the vacuum. WHAT THE WHAT?!?- The bagless feature is A PAIN IN THE A** to empty and makes this vacuum live up to its name by creating more than just a wind tunnel but a full on DUST-BOWL each and everytime the canister needs emptying. SO AWFUL.- It has become increasingly louder over time, especially when it's on the carpet setting.- Has left darkened streaks on my white, high pile rug even though it was set on the appropriate setting.- The detachable brush/tools are irritating to use due the terribly too short hose length.- It's VERY plastic-y and to replace anything other than the HEPA filter, one must unscrew all sorts of pieces of flimsy plastic and, god forbid, if anything does cracks a bit, you're left worse for wear (I tightened a screw too tight when putting a piece back together, which split the plastic in half and created another hairline crack on a different piece. So now those 2 pieces are held together with duct tape and wishful thinking that nothing else goes awry until I can afford a new/better vacuum).- Very bulky and heavy without much agility whatsoever. Also, is too thick and 'fat' in the front to go under most low-lying furniture - such as our couch, bookcases, and bed.- The vac (functionality, motor, and suction) has declined on overtime - not really surprised, though.Basically, I'd recommend something with a bag (unless you're paying A LOT and it's a high-end brand) and be sure to test the weight and versatility of movement before investing in a vac.I would not recommend this to anyone. In fact, we tend to use or small hand-held Black & Decker vac in lieu of this one even if it does take eight times longer to do the floors. It's just not worth the mess, hassle, energy, and noise to bring out this Hoover.

I wanted a bagless vacuum, but had I known this was going to be such a filthy mess to clean out all the time, I would have passed this model up.  Initially the suction was good, but it does not take long for hair, carpet fibers, and other gunk to get caught up in those hard to get to areas without having to take the dang thing apart to clean.  It really is gross to clean and like other reviewers, I often will take it outside in the warmer weather months to clean.  In the winter I put the canister in a large garbage bag and try to empty it there to keep the dust and stuff from flying around too much in the air or landing on the carpet.  The canister, etc. seem to need to be cleaned often. If not, and air flow gets clogged, the vacuum will not start until it is properly cleaned.  This happened to me a number of times when I was not on top of emptying and cleaning out the canister and filter enough.  The roller with bristols often times does not work, so it is not that useful on carpets (perhaps the belt came off).  It often sticks or just stops rolling. The wheels squeel often. When it does work, it is very noisy.  The small removeable plastic catcher that guides and holds the retractable cord, often pops out and has to be snapped back in to properly wind the cord back up.

I loved the style and the price, plus I've owned many Hoovers that I have loved over the years.  This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned.  1. I feel like I need to take a shower after emptying the canister. Just is a messy job. The filter inside the canister clogs, so I end up having to stick my hand up there to pull out all the caked on gunk. 2.  If you have kids and a dog and vacuum almost daily, the canister needs to be emptied after just about after every room for proper suction.  3.  The beater bar is weak, won't turn on a plush carpet.  If you raise it up, it spins, but then it's not doing it's job on the carpet.  4.  There are 2 removable dust filters that clog almost instantly, to get vac to function well they need to be removed and washed weekly. 5. The light burned out after a week.Those are my biggest complaints.  I do like the attachments and use frequently for dusting.  Also, if you only use it for light duty/vacuum infrequently this may be a great choice for you, especially if you can pick it up at a discount store as I did.

I kinda wish that the suction would pick up more cat fur, but the bagless part itself fills up so quickly, if you vacuum like I do, about once a week or so then be prepared to empty the canister in the middle of the vacuuming session.PROS ---1.  Self-winding, self-storage of the cord - There is a button on the side of this vacuum cleaner that, when depressed, will cause the cord to wind up so fast you have to jump to get out of it's way lest you be snapped in the calf by the thing.2.  Extension wands included - If you are trying to use this to clean a bed/furniture, then you will have no problems using the extension wands that will extend the hose to the appropriate height in order to clean off the cat/dog hair from the bed.CONS ---1. Stairs - I have stairs in my apartment, and if you are trying to vacuum them because they are carpeted then forget it!  The hose reaches barely halfway, and if you use the extension 'wands' that are included, you may as well just bend down and try to blow the dust away because the suction will decrease rapidly as you add more extension wands.2. Weight - This thing is REALLY heavy.  Coupled with the stairs, it is required that the person lug the thing up and down.  It is awkward to hold when trying to go up and down the stairs and I always feel in danger of tripping over the bulkiness of the vacuum itself and tumbling down the stairs with it.3. Pets - It is not very good when dealing with pets.  I have two cats and an apartment and I have to empty the bucket multiple times when vacuuming, and I vacuum about once a week (sometimes more, sometimes less).4. Messy Cleanup - Usually when I do cleaning I mop the floors, and when I do the vacuuming last I can't help but to get the dust everywhere.  Also, the filter is so large and bulky, it is impossible not to get dust everywhere because you can't keep all of the parts over the trash can at the same time.  If you use the easy 'release' button at the bottom of the bagless part you still have to reach up inside and get everything out before it is really clean.Overall, the cons outweigh the pros in this one.  If you want to go with something that is going to last and will pick up a lot of cat/dog hair, or if your place is bigger than your average apartment, look elsewhere I'm afraid."

It's the first bagless we've ever owned.The vacuum seems to be solidly built. We like the hose and the assorted attachments. It's easy to use (but heavier than our last one), and is also much quieter. This was a pleasant surprise. It also seems to be very efficient, and collects a lot of dirt in a very short amount of time.It's neat seeing the dirt and dust collect as you vacuum. It amazes me that dust collects that fast on our carpet, and we remove our shoes when entering the house.As this is a bagless cyclonic vacuum, emptying the cup (canister, whatever you choose to call it) can be a very messy business if you're not careful. We've found that the least messy way to do it is to hold the canister so the end is suspended *in* (not *over*) a trash can, open the bottom, and let it all fall out. Don't try tipping the mess neatly into a smaller trash can (as if you were pouring from a glass)--it's a good way to get dust everywhere. Remember to check and clean the filters regularly.Thus far we've had one mishap, when my wife accidentally vacuumed up some clothes. This caused the belt to be thrown. I was able to get it all back together, but it took some effort; much more than our previous vacuum. The belt pulley assembly is plastic, so I was afraid it'd break with all the force required to get everything back in place. No breaks so far, but I'd guess that as the plastic ages over time, and becomes brittle, the pulley assembly will break during a belt change.The only thing that we have noticed that irritates us is sometimes, if the canister is not seated properly, there is a high-pitched whistling sound when we run the vacuum, because the canister is not sealed completely to the rest of the vacuum. Readjusting the canister takes care of the problem.Overall, we're very satisfied with it and would recommend it."

I bought this because of the range of attachments and the extra long hose it includes, for cleaning stairs. But 6 months of using this has convinced me that it is a shoddy product. The pros:-> Extra long hose is really long and flexible and makes most corners accessible. But there is no hook or crevice in the cleaner to store / keep the hose attachment. So you literally have to drag it with you or hang it around your neck :))-> The automatic cord rewind is really easy to work and very convenient.The cons:-> The attachments are attached to the cleaner via the hose on the side. The attachments don't fix tightly, there is no lock mechanism. You lug the vacuum cleaner up a flight of stairs and the attachment comes loose, falls down the stairs. You have to - Go down pick it up, attach & repeat this process endlessly! The design is very sub standard.-> HEAVY. To be fair the package was heavy when I bought it and I expected it to be heavy. It feels heavier because there is no convenient way to pick it up when you go up the stairs or something. You have to pick it up by the handle on top of the cleaner and that puts excessive strain on the lower back.-> The pet-hair removing attachment is absolutely useless. The brushes on the attachment get stuck and stop rotating as soon as it picks up a bunch of hair. For a pet-hair removing attachment it has very low threshold for hair!! You are better off using just the extension attachments and a lot of lint rollers instead!-> The 'sucking power' (no pun intended!) of the machine is not great either. I have to set the brush to lowest height to make sure it brushes the carpet clean. I expect 6 months down the line, I expect it'll just stop working!-> Last, but certainly not the least, the machine is very poorly made. The attachments are already coming loose. The parts look like bad grade plastic. It is as cheap and flimsy as it looks despite how expensive it is!Wouldn't buy it again if it were offered free to me! My old Bissell is much better than this one. I wish I had just bought the attachments for the old one instead of springing money on this Hoover!"

Dirt needs to be emptied on a regular basis and dirt canister and filters need to be cleaned periodically. Turbo Pet Hair brush loses power when it comes in contact with surface (mine does anyway).I researched vacuums for a few weeks before deciding on this one. The mixed reviews make it very hard to determine what vacuum to buy. The fact that I was able to get this unit for 50% off it's price, helped make my decision easier. I couldn't be happier with that decision. It works great on hardwood floors and carpeting.  My preference was to buy a Hoover Windtunnel bagged vacuum, but the extra cleaning power that this model has, is worth having to empty the dirt and clean the filter unit periodically. I couldn't believe the amount of dirt it vacuumed up from my rugs and hardwood floors. Obviously my old Hoover Windtunnel wasn't doing the job. I use my old vacuum to help clean the dirt cup and filter, it makes the job much easier.  My turbo pet hair brush is almost useless, when it comes in contact with the surface you are cleaning, it stops. Fortunately, I still have the turbo brush from my old vacuum, and I am able to use it with my new cleaner. I love the cord rewind feature, I always hated to have to wind up vacuum cords! Works great! Never had a problem with the cord retracting on its' own, as another reviewer stated. Because of this feature, the cord is somewhat slimmer though. The automatic or manual brush turn off feature means less wear and tear on the belt and hardwood floors. The Durabelt #170 belt available at Walmart fits this model, this number belt is actually made for Hoover Windtunnels.  It seems to be just a little bigger then the one that came with the vacuum (same width though), but it works perfect, and is much eaiser to put on. I believe that the original belt was probably too tight anyway since it broke after only two uses.  Please note that the Durabelt #160 does not work with this model, I already tried since it is the size my old vacuum uses.I highly recommend this vacuum if you don't mind having to periodically clean the dirt cup and filter. Great cleaning power. Be sure to clean the filters periodically since dirty filters will reduce the suction power of the vacuum dramatically, including the suction through the hose. Clean filters make a world of difference in the operation and efficiency of this vacuum."

Main issue, the belts refuse to stay on. Yes belts(s) plural. If the main drive belt isn't coming off, the small beater bar belt is coming loose. You may make it through a vacuuming session without a belt popping off, but never 2 uses. Do Not get close to a rug or carpet or you will be taking this baby apart to reattach a belt. This has been happening from month one. My wife's pride kept me from taking it back since she convinced me to get it because of it's power head for cleaning pet hair off the couches and such.  Well the power head worked for about 2 weeks before it stopped rotating fast enough to be useful.  This attachment uses suction and another small belt to spin the brushes in the attachment around. But, here's where the second issues arises, the the vacuum isn't powerful enough to make it really useful.  In everyday use, you have to get right up on dust bunnies or cat hair before this unit will draw it up into it's 'windtunnel + cyclonic' chamber.  The suction on this is such a joke.If you choose to get this vacuum, keep a Philips head screwdriver, a broom and a dustpan mounted to the unit. At this point, a year later, only the broom and dustpan are working. The screwdriver is being retired for time served.  Again, this is a POS."

Speaking of  attachments, the one with the rotating brush stopped working after one use, the crevice tool doesn't really have a place for storage on the machine, and the brush keeps falling off the small upholstry tool.

I have always been a Hoover fan and this model does not disappoint. What prompted the need for yet another vacuum cleaner was my growing intolerance of lugging the machine up and down the stairs. Our current Hoover Bagless Windtunnel model has been a great vacuum, of which we only had one complaint- the messy cylinder filter inside the dirt cup that seemed to hold on to odors, particularly dog hair from our two hairly house mates! Regardless of how well we cleaned the filter, it still seemed to spew that noxious odor through the house every time we vacuumed.We decided to retire that unit to the upper floor where the dogs are not allowed, and look for something that would handle the downstairs 'kennel'. Enter the Hoover U5780900.  This model does not use a filter within the dirt cup, but rather a series of chambers to remove and trap the dirt in the canister. I'm not a vacuum designer, but it appears to be a similar method used by another EXPENSIVE brand name vacuum. So far so good. The canister empties fairly easily from the bottom (still a two handed excersize) and if allowed to get too full, a little assistance is required to extricate the large lint and hair balls that will no doubt collect. Not a big deal to me and I appreciate not having the dirty filter to clean. The dust cup disassembles further and can be easily washed out in the sink on occasion, but not required after every use.This vacuum also features an on/off control for the beater bar for using on hard surfaces and auto brush-off when in the upright position for using attachments. I also love the cord rewind feature. Step on the button and the cord winds back into the unit. The cord has ample length to vacuum 2-3 rooms from one outlet.Suction seems to be very powerful and does not seem to diminish until the dirt canister gets VERY full. I am easily able to vacuum several rooms without emptying the cup (1300 sq feet). I will also note that this vacuum is remarkably quiet in comparison to other vacuums we've owned.The provided attachments are nothing out of the ordinary, although the turbo brush (air powered) seemed to work better than on our previous model. The hose could be longer, but I understand an add-on section is available through Hoover if needed.I'm neither impressed nor disappointed with the quality of the unit. I'm sure that with reasonable care, the unit will provide years of use.The only reservation I might have on is the overall weight of the unit. This this is HEAVY. I suppose this is somewhat beneficial in maintaining good contact with the carpet (We have a light weight Bissel that hops all over the floor)but could be a serious drawback for many people.All said, there isn't much I would change about this unit, although I could do with out the Motor City inspired chrome details.Good job Hoover!"

I wasn't thrilled about a bagless, but didn't have much choice unless I wanted to spend $500 so I took it home.The good:It's very quietIt appears to pick up a lot of stuff in the clear receptacle.The bad:It leaves a lot of debris in it's wakeIt's F I L T H Y to empty the container.  Dust everywhere...grossPet hair gets stuck way up inside the container so you have to either reach up inside and pull it out or take it apart and still reach in to get it loose.The light died in less than a weekThe beater bar is making noises like it has a bad bearing.  They don't use bearings so what is actualy making noise is plastic on plastic surfaces with dirt in them  That spells death the to the beater bar.The cord retraction mechanism is already weak after one month of use.  Soon, it will no longer fully retract the cord.When using the attchments and hose, any pull on the hose makes the unit tip over and crash to the floor.You'll need a shop vac to clean the cyclonic thingy.  It gets dust all in the tiny holes and they clog thus redering the unit with reduced suction.  Eventually, you'll need to disassemble the cyclone to clean it.  Poor design.Overall this vacuum sucks and not in a good way.  Flimsy plastic, poor design and cheap parts make it a unit to avoid at all costs.  Hoover's quality is abysmal.

While it is a good unit, and seems to do better than my old Dyson did, now I realize I should have shelled out the extra money to have gotten another Dyson.Pros-Better at getting cat hair up than my Dyson (but my Dyson did the same thing when I first got it, but it is 4 yrs old and was beginning to lose its suction)-Somewhat sturdy unit, although it squeaks because of the plastic (could be considered a con due to shoddy materials due to overseas mfg)Cons-The cord is situated in the wrong location, in my opinion. It is constantly getting under the wheels when I go back and forth with the unit through the normal cleaning motions (even happens when I do my best to hold the cord up and out of the way) - I also have to make sure my feet are out of the way when I goto retract the cord, otherwise I'll end up with nice welt on my foot/ankle from the plug.-As already said on another review, the dirt receptable fills up quickly, especially if you use it on the lowest setting for the brush bar. Too much of a hassle to try and empty the unit also as I have already had to pull out stuff that has gotten stuck up in the jar (mainly carpet fuzz)-The center of gravity on this unit is way outta whack. I can't get but maybe 2ft at most away without the hose pulling enough to pull the whole unit down on to the floor (my Dyson 'rolled' with me). As I have already found out, if you don't situate yourself just right, you'll have this come down on to your leg, foot or back. To me this is the largest drawback of this unit.Hoover could learn alot if they would just get ahold of a few Dysons and study them, and see what they are doing wrong. Certainly won't consider another Hoover because of the already short time I've used this unit"

The repair center says it needs a new agitator brush roll, problem is no one, including Hoover has one. What kind of company sells a product and doesn't have any parts for it? My advice, put your money into another brand and don't risk getting stuck with a vacuum you can't use and worse, the manufacturer, is too unprepared to fix."
"1372","XX","B000REMVGK","3.0","September 22, 2007","A3W411P9H6QKEW","Hoover Cyclonic Vacuums","[EDIT 9/1/2009] There are newer models from Hoover that better mimic the design of Dyson's multi-cyclone technology, making them somewhat easier to empty/clean. The Turbo Cyclonic (Target) is a nearly exact clone of the DC14 and Hoover Whisper Cyclonic (Walmart) is similar to the DC14 but with a quieter motor. Both do not have a self-rewinding cord, but both are cheaper than the Mach 5, at about $100. Nevertheless, they are all bagless. What I have discovered that is an inherent part of the design of all bagless vacuums is that the process of emptying and cleaning the dirt cup is too messy to be worthwhile. I'm a clean freak and have dust allergies. I spend more time emptying and cleaning the dust bin and filters than I do actually vacuuming! I find that I put off vacuuming until the discomfort of the dirty floor exceeds the discomfort of emptying the dust bin and cleaning the filters. I am very strongly considering buying a bagged vacuum to replace this one even though there is nothing functionally wrong with it.After using this vacuum for two years, I can say that it continues to clean admirably. Suction continues to be strong and with no loss. However, I have noticed that if you don't empty the dirt cup with each use, the filters get clogged quickly and the vacuum begins to smell of dust. That happened to us and since I don't know how to replace or clean the HEPA filter (it's not washable), our vacuum continues to smell of dust. I'm attributing that to user error, however.---- Original Review ----Pros: Quiet motor, cord rewind, powerful suction, brush-bar shut-off.Cons: Small dirt cup, messy to empty, hassle to clean, heavy.The Bottom Line: This is the best value in cyclone vacuums, with all the typical benefits and drawbacks of that design type, plus a few special features--like the cord rewind and brush-bar shut-off.Full ReviewThe Hoover Windtunnel Cyclonic is the same machine as the Hoover Mach 5, which is sold exclusively at Walmart for about $20 less. The only differences are that Mach 5 is bright orange and chrome, whereas the Windtunnel Cyclonic is a much more 'normal' looking vacuum.The Hoover Mach 5 (and Mach 3) are replacements for the Fusion. The Fusion did poorly in Consumer Reports testing because of dust in its emissions. The new models attempt to rectify that problem with better filters. The Mach 3 has electrostatic filters for the pre-motor and final stage filter. The Mach 5 caught my attention because it has an electrostatic pre-motor filter and a HEPA final stage filter, both of which are cleanable and thus never need replacing. I had intended to wait until CR could test these new models, but went ahead and bought a Mach 5 when I saw one brand new and unopened on Craigslist for $100 ($75 below retail after taxes).As my friends and I used the machine several times in the course of moving out of our apartment, several strengths and weaknesses became apparent: First, the strengths are all those advertised--cord rewind, quiet motor, powerful suction, no loss of suction, easy to use tools, brush-bar shut-off. All those operate as advertised and the construction of the machine is by and large high quality, with only a few cheap-feeling things here and there. Fit and finish is good as well. And there is no problem with emissions. The motor is quiet (as far as vacuums go) and makes a lower-pitch noise than most. The brush-bar automatically shuts off when the machine is put in the upright position, and it may be shut-off manually using the foot-lever. It is a bit top-heavy, but not so much as to make it hard to maneuver, and the handle adjusts for height. It's really very easy to use and effective at cleaning.However, there are a few draw-backs. (1) The brush-bar is very aggressive. On our old and poor quality carpet, setting it to anything lower than the middle setting resulted in large quantities of carpet fuzz being generated and sucked into the vacuum. The carpet height adjustment for our medium-low height carpet ended up being set to a medium-high height setting to alleviate the problem. (2) The first issue aggravates the second, which is that the dust bin is small and fills up quickly. Despite the large clear bin, there is actually a 'full' line marked near the bottom quarter of the bin and it must be emptied once the bin reaches this mark or you will begin to lose suction as the high-speed cyclone is unable to work properly. (3) Emptying the dust bin is a relatively easy task, however, some dust clings to the cyclone assembly and must be brushed off with the brush tool. While it does detach nicely from the bin to allow for easy cleaning, it is still a messy process compared to removing and replacing a bag. And there is a tip at the end of the cyclone that requires cleaning to make sure it remains clear of debris, since this is the exit for the high-speed cyclone and if it clogs the cyclone will not work properly.Owners of cyclone vacuums often think that their machines do not need to have filters serviced. This is not true. Even Dysons have to have their pre-motor and HEPA filters cleaned from time to time (this is the leading cause of loss of suction for Dysons, and often is not made clear to Dyson owners). So too with the Mach 5. The pre-motor filter is located above the dust bin and is a washable electro-static filter (let it dry 24 hours before reinstalling). The HEPA filter is in a tray marked 'HEPA' below the dust bin. That may be cleaned but not washed. These filters should be cleaned about once every couple months or so, depending on how often you vacuum.So in summary, this is a good vacuum cleaner for the money. As with all vacuums, it is not perfect. It suffers some of the common drawbacks of bagless vacuums (namely the messier dust-emptying) while solving the problem of loss of suction. I would like to have a larger dust bin, but once the carpet height is set correctly, even the small one that it has is sufficient for a day's worth of cleaning. I recommend it, especially if you can find a good coupon for Walmart (the only place it is available retail) or other good deal (such as I did on Craigslist)."

Then the brush stops working all together. When the brush isn't working, the vaccuum does not suck up a thing! Not a thing!!!I took it to the service center twice and it would work again for a couple of weeks and die. Total piece of crap!!! I am now shopping for another vacuum... uggh :(Don't buy this vacuum unless you enjoy wasting your money!"

The agitator brush works off of suction, not a motorized belt, so it barely turns and when you put it on a chair or stairs to suck up pet hair, it stops turning.2 weeks after purchasing this model, it overheated in mid vacuum.  Now it overheats after 10 minutes of vacuuming.  In reading other reviews, I see this is a common problem.I'm very disappointed in the function of this machine.  I can't wait to replace it with something better. Next time I will read reviews FIRST!"

It is light enough, but the wheels are cheap and big; making it hard to manuever.  Skimpy on the cord (really short), the hose (very short). Need to empty often as hair collects on one side and the wind tunnel stops working.  I will eventually buy another vacumn with more substance.  But if your vacumn is history and you need something right away, this is a good segway until you have time to test them all out."

I have a 90lb mixed shephard dog who sheds like crazy.  Her hair was driving me so crazy that, besides my many swiffer products, I bought the vacuum broom, the electric swiffer product that vacuums on one side and cleans on the other, I have two carpet cleaners and two bag vacuum cleaners, yet still, I was just going to throw out my runner (rug).  When I bought this vacuum (I got it for a steal at Kohl's with a 30% off coupon and on sale) that rug was my first challenge. I had it on the back deck for a long time before brining it back in and deciding it was going to have to go. It is a fairly dark rug and my dog is light brown. This cleaner COMPLETELY cleared my rug of that dog hair. As a matter of fact, I was disgusted by the amount of hair in my upstairs carpet. My first floor is hardwood so I was always able to clean those, but it was just a never ending task. I went nuts when I first bought this cleaner and I still love using it. I have only had it for about a month, so I take heed to the comments on parts, etc.. Hopefully, I will not find such issues but if I do, I'll let you know."

It worked great for the first month or two, but after 5 months I am ready to throw it in the trash. It is not worth the frustration.Let me count the ways:1. It doesn't pick up hair.2. The beater bar won't work unless the vacuum is almost parallel to the floor and set on a high carpet setting, which then doesn't really touch the carpet and pick anything up.3. The automatic cord rewind is continuously rewinding the cord so you have to keep pulling it out. Not a big deal the first 10 times...just keep at it and it is so annoying and seriously slows you down as well as pulls the plug from the wall.4. The attachment hose won't stay in the vacuum when in use...so you are vacuuming and realize the reason it isn't picking up anything is because the suction hose has come undone.5. The automatic carpet tool doesn't work. That's all...just flat out doesn't work. Never did.6. The just plain old carpet tool has to be at just the right angle or it doesn't work. Oh, and it doesn't pick up hair either.7. It is really really heavy.8. It doesn't clean the carpet.9. The bagless canister has to be emptied constantly (it always seems full...not sure what it is picking up because I can still see the hair/paper/lint/etc. on the floor.)I can't believe Hoover put out this product.

He said this was a better vacuum than some $300-$500 vacuums he sees when he visits homes.  The vacuum picked up very, very well, in a home that includes four children, one dog, and two cats.  The pick-up power in this vacuum is undeniably great.However, after the first year, the agitator brush quit working.  We narrowed it down to the belt that runs it, and easily found the belt number listed in the parts manual of the vacuum.  Finding a store that sold the belt was another matter, but eventually we found it at Sears.  We replaced the belt and the vacuum again worked great.

It had many features that I liked, one being the retractible cord.  I loved the mini-pet brush as we have three dogs.  One that sheds a good bit.We have a cleaning lady, so I only vacuum in between cleanings, so very light use. Then the belt started squealing.  I took it apart, played with it, cleaned it, put it back together and it didn't help.  After a couple uses, the beater bar just quit working.  I took it to the shop, they replaced the belts.  That lasted for one more good vacuuming, then the squealing was back.  Second use, the beater bar quit again.  Its like the plastic contraption that tightens the beater bar when you step on the pedal just doesn't tighten enough, so there's not enough tension on the bar...so it won't spin.So, today I did a little research and bought a Eureka Airspeed from Walmart for $119.  Putting it together only took a few minutes.  The cleaning lady came today, and for the heck of it I revacuumed what she had done in the living room.  After just one room, I threw away about 2 cups of plain ole dirt.  Not dog hair, or debris.  Just dirt.  And we just had the carpets professionally cleaned about 3 weeks ago.I'll miss the retractable cord, but the Eureka Airspeed is much lighter and easier to push and definitely does a better job, and does a better job on the edges than any vacuum I've ever used.

It has super suction and picks up everything.  There is an occasional high pitched squeal that is associated with the cyclonic air intake, but that is not an issue.  After about 5 months of use (4 cats and a dog) we started noticing that the brush wans't working properly.  I took the bottom plate off the vacuum and removed the belt which was showing wear from the brush dragging and then I discovered the real problem...hair wrapped around the spindle of the brush.  I cleaned off all the hair from the ends of the brush spindle to free up the bearings and allow the brush to spin properly and then for a temporary fix for the belt, I flipped it inside out to get a little more life while I searched for a replacement.  Fired it up and it worked perfectly.  There is a design flaw that allows hair to gather on the brush bearings, so it's something that I'll have to clean out about every 3 months or so as maintenance.Finding a belt has been tougher than I thought.  The belt is listed as 40201-271 which is no where to be found.  I even went to the Hoover web site and this part number doesn't exist.  This is the flat drive belt, not a v-belt as indicated in one of the other reviews.  I think the v-belt is for another part.The vacuum is a bit on the heavy side, but so was our last Wind Tunnel.  The hose is long enough to reach up our stairs so my wife doesn't have to carry it up the stairs for that purpose.  We have a light weight Oreck vacuum for our second floor carpets, but it doesn't have nearly the suction of the Hoover.The cannister seems to fill up pretty fast and is not fun to empty.  It seems like no matter which way you go, top or bottom, you end up with a mess.  The seal at the bottom of the filter and cannister is a mess since you can't ever get it lined up perfectly."

I didn't intend to use it that much that quick, but I really enjoy tools that work and this one definitely does.  I have 2 large dogs and had a Eureka on it's last leg - the home would smell like wet dog every time we would vacuum even though it had a brand new bag and HEPA filter installed.  I read some reviews on a different model by Hoover, went to the big box store, but they didn't have the model I had done so much research on.  I took a shot in the dark and brought this one home with no research just because I liked the idea of the retractable cord. THIS VACUUM IS FANTASTIC.  I had previously been researching the Dysons as well and had even used a few before - this vacuum performs every bit as good if not better for way less money.  I can't believe how much dog hair, dirt, and dust it sucked up out of the carpet and off the tile, and now the house smells clean and fresh - no more dog smell!  The on-board pet brush is fantastic too.  I unintentionally gave it a durability test when I accidentally tipped it over just after unpacking it and cringed as the handle slammed into the tile floor - this is how my friend broke his Dyson - Hoover took it like a champ.  No damage.Regarding other reviews I saw one that indicated the brush won't work after 3 uses - mine still does after over a dozen HEAVY uses.I read another that complained about the belt - the belt on mine says Good-Year and it hasn't broken, frayed, or slowed down at all.One review called it a boat anchor and said it's impossible to carry - IT'S 23 POUNDS YOU WEENIE, and it's on WHEELS.  That's about what a typical 1 to 2 yr old child weighs.  In all fairness, if you have a 2 story and are elderly and/or handicapped in some way then perhaps this vacuum may weigh a bit too much for you.  I haven't had to lift it since I took it out of the box, so...Some are commenting that it's messy to empty - there are two ways to empty it: there is a door that swings open at the bottom and drops the dirt out, or you can unlock the top by twisting it, remove the cone, and gently dump the contents into the trash without creating a could of dust...  that also keeps the seal on the bottom of the trap door from getting dirty.  The retractable cord has been awesome.  What you probably wouldn't guess unless I told you or you read the name is that I'm a man and don't typically like to vacuum.  My girlfriend is ecstatic that I enjoy vacuuming the house, and has even gone so far as to take pictures of me doing it to prove it.  When I wanted a great drill that would last I bought a DeWalt - still have it and love to use it.  When I wanted a truck I bought an F-150 - over 200K miles and still rolling.  Now I lucked out and have a vacuum that has really improved the cleanliness of the house.If I ever have a problem then I will by all means update this review, but so far I'm impressed."

I found two:1) If you feel up to it, call your local vacuum repair shop (I just googled it and found a number) and spend about $10 for them to replace the belt for you.2) If you are willing to wait a few days for delivery go to the hoover website and order 'item# 40201200  WINDTUNNL V-BELT'  for  $3.99 plus shipping and handling.I ordered the parts myself. they are very easy to install, all you need is a screwdriver. You can also download the manual that matches your model number and get replacement part #s for just about anything.Here's the link: [...]Hope this helps!"

I contacted Hoover and their only response was 'take it to a service center.'

Hoover website does not even list the correct belts for the unit. Can not find the belts anywhere locally. I had to buy the belts that it needed. Replaced the belt and the agitator brush worked for 1 cleaning and quit working again. I called Hoover and they said that they have never heard of this problem before and that I needed to take it to a local Service Center. I called the local service center and they asked me the model number and I was told 'You poor Soul.' The service center knew all about the problem. He told me the problems that I was having with the unit and that it was a design flaw with the unit, Hoover is aware of the problem and that they are not doing anything about it. So i am stuck with a vacuum that the agitator brush does not spin. Another waste of money on another product that is cheaply made and Hoover doesn't care. Hoover has poor customer support and do not care about the quality of their products. Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!!!!!"

To empty the canister, you have twist off the cyclonic thing from it and bang it against the garbage can and it makes a huge cloud of dirt - and there is no way to clean the inside of the cyclonic thing - its dirty and gross.  Then you have to clean out the canister and the rubber gasket on the bottom of the canister isnt flush anymore, so there is a layer of dirt around the rim you have to clean.  Why would they make a vacuum where the bottom of the canister opens????? Its get filled with dirt and leaves dirt all over my house!  And I dont mind a heavy vacuum, but I have a ton of stairs in my house and there is no handle to carry it easily.  I'm already looking for a different vacuum because I HATE HATE HATE this one!

It does a great job on the rugs picking up dog hair & with the on off switch for the brush does a good job on bare floors as well. The handle on the short hose is very nice when using the pet hair hand tool. The vacuum is heavy so it needs a longer hose to do stairs. Mine did not come with a bare floor or brush attachment so I am ordering these online. Finding a longer hose has turned into a problem as the company I ordered from sent the wromg hose & now does not want to accept the return. Cleaning the filter is no fun. Now I have two dogs, but vacuum twice a week, but if the filter gets clogged I usually use another vacuum to clear & clean it. After a month of use there is a high pitched whine when I start it.

With a lot of cat hair to pick up that has been left behind by my old vacuum, I have had to brush off the filter several times, again, not a big deal to me. The hose is sturdy and long, and the cord rewind feature is a plus. I like the fact that the beater does not run when the vacuum is in the upright position, and has an on-off switch for hard floors.

By the same reason I probably wouldn't recommend it to people living in house with a few bedrooms, vacuuming may take a lot of time for them.5) Easy to cleanCons:1) Doesn't have 'pet brush' attachment (like little power brush for furniture) so it's hard to clean carpets from fur where vacuum can't go2) Doesn't work good on hard floors (suction power is too low), but since I have just a few sq. feet of hard floor in my apartment, I don't count it as a big cons for myself.Overall, it's a great basic vacuum for small carpeted apartments.

We have a 1200 sq ft vacation home, and it vacuums very well.  Comparing it to my $500 Dyson at our primary home, I'd recommend the Hoover just as much as the Dyson.  Some people mentioned that the path is a bit narrow or the cord too short, but not enough to impede performance.  Suction is great.  It doesn't do a stellar job at bare floors, but still works well if you move slowly.  I'm not a fan of the wand, I wish it had a wide tube instead of the crevice tool that is permanently attached.  It's also a tad short in my opinion, but it works.  It also doesn't edge very well, but for the money I saved I can spend an extra minute going around baseboards slowly and using the wand.  I think it's a bit louder than others, but that could just be because I haven't vacuumed in a long time ;).  It's a vacuum, it's going to be loud.  It's exceptionally light weight, I'm 6 months pregnant and don't have trouble carrying it up and down stairs like I do my Dyson.  Assembly was easy.

I got it from my local w-mart for considerably less than the price listed here. The vacuum is very small and light, and thus very easy to handle and move around.  Plus, the handle can be detached for even more compact storage.  The sucking power is comparable to greater models and very satisfactory. There is no height adjustment but this doesn't seem to affect performance.  I vacuumed thin carpets, a thick rug, and bare floors (wood and tile) with ease.  In fact there is a pedal switch that allows for turning off the brushes, so you can use suction only on hardwood floor (thus without risk of scratching your valuable wood!).  The vacuum is relatively quiet when operating (comparably to others I've used, anyway), and especially quiet when in suction only mode.  Importantly, it does not suffer from the 'jet stream' exhaust effect like many other models (maybe just a tiny bit on the sides, but really not much), so it does not blow away dust from all around the vacuum when you use it :)  The on-board tools are pretty basic: the detachable handle is nice as it allows for reaching into tight spaces, but also for doing tall spots like window blinds, etc.  There is also a little brush, and that's about it!  Cleaning the dirt cup is very easy, although as with most vacuums of this type, you better do it outdoors!  The only negative thing I can find is that this vacuum will likely be inadequate for vacuuming large areas, due to its small size and coverage.  But it is just perfect for my 2-bdr apartment!  Anyway, if you are in the market for a vacuum which is easy to operate, easy to store, with more than satisfactory performance, for small spaces (I would say up to about 1000 sq. feet) and without braking the bank, this is definitely a great option."

This isn't a flimsy-cheapo machine.After a couple months of frequent weekly use, I noticed a drop in the suction. At that point, I removed and washed the filters (they were FILTHY -- I won't go that long without washing them again!), and my fiance cleared out a piece of plastic zip-tie that was stuck in the hose and had caused a hair clog (thus the drop in suction).

I was using the hose attachment and sucking the tumbleweeds of pet hair behind my couch. The hose is a bit short, so I set the vacuum on the couch (which I used to do with my dyson) so I could reach over the back of the couch. I didn't turn off the rotating bristles (dyson bristles automatically turned off when in upright position)... and they tore holes right through the cushion cover! I am glad this was on the cushion and not on my carpet though. I bought a replacement cover for the cushion but just know that when using the hose attachment TURN OFF THE BRISTLES! They will tear right through. I only have myself to blame for this. Also tie up your drapes! I can only imagine what they would do to my sheer drapes. I have been staring at these great reviews, both on Amazon and Walmart.com, and I couldn't get myself to believe them in a vacuum at only $58 (walmart price). I bought another vacuum, wasn't happy with it, returned it and gave into this little beast. It's pretty incredible. For it's price, it is definitely a 5 star! As a vacuum in general, I would give it 3-4 stars.Things I LOVE about this vacuum:-Light-The bagless cyclone canister. I have had disasters with the messes bagless vacuums make when emptying them and trying to clean out every last bit. This canister empties at the of a touch of a button. SO easy.-The green to red button when the canister is full. If you can train yourself to keep an eye on that, it's a nice feature to let you know, 'time to empty'-The hose wand. Some have complained that the hose wand is the handle. This was the same feature (with a different anatomy) as the dyson has which I grew to love and love it again in this machine.-The black pinched tip at the end of the hose isn't removable. I thought I didn't like this feature but it is nice so you are less likely to suck up a large piece that could clog up your hose. It is also one less piece to keep track of and have to put together.-It truly has great suction. I bought this the day we got new carpet installed so I cannot say it pulled up a whole bunch of dirt yet but I feel this was the good start to new carpet.-You can turn off the bristles. I am surprised to find that many vacuums even in the $100 range do not have this feature.Things I don't like about this vacuum (there is nothing I HATE about it):-Yes, cord is a little short but I have an older home with smaller rooms so it isn't an issue for me.-Hose is a little short but it is easy to hold this vacuum in your hand and carry it around with you.-Bristles don't automatically turn off when in upright position. Be sure to turn them off.-Not great for small pieces on hard floors. I was hoping I could use this on hard floors as well, as I have a lot of hard floors. With bristles off, it failed to pick up about half of the kitty litter in my laundry room.-Does not have a hight adjustment. This is my biggest issue. I have 1 shag rug that I am afraid may burn out the motor. It is a little difficult to push across the rug and seems to work a little too hard. I might use my old dyson just for this rug as it does an okay job for it. I also think if it had a height adjustment it may work better on bare floors on the lowest setting.-Many of the Hoover Vacuums have a retractable cords that rewind. For some reason, wrapping up a vacuum cord is some huge annoyance to me... just one of those things. I wish this had that feature. Good thing it's a short cord ;o).-It is a pretty ugly and dated looking vacuum lol. If that is important to you."

Definetely worth the price and picks up so much hair, dust, and dirt. Works much stronger then my cheap Eureka. Perfect for pet hair. What ever you do, DO NOT WASH THE HEPA FILTER, just replace it LoL. Made the mistake of washing it and now the vacuum doesn't work. But it was my fault. I would also buy a spare belt because after a month or two the vacuum started making a knocking noise due to a loose belt. Overall, great product for $58."

I have had my Hoover vacuum for more than 3 months and if it broke today, I'd run out and buy another one.  It has earned what I paid for it already.  I have a Jack Russell Terrier who sheds quite a bit.  I have had no problems vacuuming up his hair.  My home is 2600 square feet on 3 floors, and I vacuum at least one room everyday.  I have a very expensive Kirby that I have now retired to the garage.My Hoover is so lightweight that my 8-yr-old daughter can easily maneuver it - and does!  I initially just purchased this for my carpeted rooms, but I also use it periodically on my hardwood floors, and although it does not do as good a job, I did not buy it for hardwood floors - that's a bonus.I wish that Amazon sold this directly.  I, like many others, purchased my vacuum at Wal-Mart for under $60.I will purchase another little Hoover soon to keep on another floor.  There are not many things that I recommend without hesitation, but I highly recommend this little Hoover."

I used it as soon as I brought it home. Don't know as to how long it will last but it vacuumed so wonderfully that I want to keep it forever! It's very light weight and so easy to move around. In fact, it moves forward on it's own which was so funny which meant you don't have to put all that effort into pushing it forward. Because it is very light weight it was even easy to pull it back without breaking an arm! Highly effective cleaning and picked up EVERYTHING it went over. Emptying it was easy even for a child to do. Very easy to get it to go in to small spaces and under chairs. What impressed me also was the low noise level of this vacuum. Unlike every other vacuum I tried, this one does not have high pitched noises or shrills.It left my carpet fluffy and clean. The wire is shorter than the large vacuums and the tube is much shorter too. But it doesn't matter to me as this machine cleans way better than any other that has all the extras. Highly recommend."

Used twice so far for a 2 Bed apt (~800 sq ft carpet area). So far so good. Easy to operate, light weight to move around while on, sucks dirt well, cleaning was not so difficult. For cleaning, lid opens at the bottom which is convenient.. no need to tilt, but need to be careful to focus straight to your trash-can, otherwise will make the place little messy.. Its expensive at Amazon.. not sure why. Got a better deal in Walmart 'site to store' shipping..When using in Suction mode, noticed few dirts, few hair pieces were not sucked from Hard wood floor..

This lasted for exactly a week. Then the clogs started. Now the vacuum has to be completely disassembled every time we use it. Why is that? Pet hair completely clogs the hoses. I haven't emptied the tank in several months, because nothing ever makes it there, it all gets stuck in the hoses. Emptying them completely does no good; they just clog right back up. The clogs cause suction to decrease drastically, and the vacuum winds up moving more dust around than it cleans up. Complete waste of money."

I paid about $60 + tax @ Walmart locally for it around the end of April/early May and it worked great at first! The vacuum is easy to clean, you can wash out the sponge-type filter but make sure it's 100% dry before replacing as it'll grow mold AND any moisture will affect the suction. I'm not too fond of the handle wand as it has a permanently affixed crevice tool on it which then goes into the brush tool. The crevice tool seems to leak around where it's attached to the handle/wand although the suction is pretty good. Just recently I decided to vacuum up the same area a few times to have almost the same amount in the dirt cup each time which lets me know that it's not working to its' fullest potential anymore. You can't adjust the height of the brush head to different carpeting, rugs, etc. but we don't have rugs here so it's fine with our particular type of carpeting but I don't think it'd work as well on shag carpet. Cord is slightly short but I don't mind that so much. All in all, for the price, it isn't BAD but I wish they had the vacuum I'd wanted in stock at the time so I wouldn't have to replace the vacuum within 6 months or so.Pros:Very lightweightCompactSimple to operate (push down with foot to use & foot pedal to turn on)One-touch dirt cup emptyingPriceCons:Leaks around wand crevice toolFilters cost 1/2 as much as the cost of the vacuum itselfCrevice tool isn't removable & no extension wandsLasts about 6mos"

I have thick carpeting and own 4 cats who decided they could shed their short hair anywhere. I needed a vacuum cleaner with a power rotor. I have a vacuum without a power rotor that doesn't pick up hair.This vacuum works as well or better than my old heavy Kirby tank for picking up hair from the carpet which somehow gets woven into the mesh. (I think my cats do that on purpose when I'm not looking). You still have to go over the area a couple of times. I don't mind that as long as it works. The biggest draw back is that the dirt compartment fills up with cat hair very fast and I am lucky if I can get a whole room done before I have to empty the container. Fortunately I live in the country and I can just dump it outside. Perhaps the container filling up so fast is a testimony to how well it was picking up.This was the second cheapest model I found with a power rotor. Dirt Devil has one that was less expensive, but my local W-Mart was out of them."

I paid extra for express shipping, but it arrived no faster than regular shipping would've gotten it to me.

It replaced our Dyson when it broke down a year ago.  Unfortunately, the parts around the vacuum don't last.  The on/off push button fell off.  Because it is small, you have to empty frequently.  Because we have a Great Pyr for a pet, his long hair clogs the vacuum constantly.  We have had 3 of these in 1 year.  We vacuum a lot (dog owner) and expect our vacuum to last.

Needless to say the whole thing got mucked up with dust.  But this thing is completely washable.

It sucks up pretty good; like everyone else said, the cord gets in the way and is too short, easy fix with an extension cord, oh and it's loud compared to the hated Kenmore I was using. That said it beat the hell out  dragging around the dead dog that is the kenmore cylinder that cost over $400.00 5 years ago and looks like it will live forever curse it! That thing is now sitting in the garage and this little sweetie is in the closet so what does that tell you? I have 2 dogs that shed like crazy and tile floors with two small rugs at the doors; I emptied the canister 3 times, didn't really have to do it that often but it was very easy to do and I got carried away. The rooms did not smell bad when I was done, like they do with the kenmore, and no more smelly bags full of old dog hair. If I had the money I would probably go up to a quieter one with a longer cord but maybe not, I only use it once a week, the other days I sweep with a broom, old school, quiet and kinda zenish. I will post if I have problems or if/when it dies. 10/15/2012 Having lived with this thing for over a year I can tell you my only problem is the hose that goes down into the guts that you have to get off to attach it to the extension/handle when you want to get into corners or get cobwebs is really had to release. And that reminds me the hose is too short to get the cobwebs off the ceilings. Everything else is still good."

It's very light weight but very powerful, and was really affordable!I'm a seamstress and have been cursing the countless threads on my carpet that no vacuum can seem to pick up, but the nano sucks them up without a problem every time! I kept expecting it to lose its steam in time, but even with weekly use it still doing as well as the day I bought it. I had to clean out the filter for the first time last month and it wasn't hard at all. As described in another review, there are two filters, one you empty like the canister, and a foam filter you pull out and wash with water. The best part is there is a little meter that turns red when its time to clean out the filter.My only complaints are that the cord is a little short and the canister is small-- but maybe thats why they call it the nano. The first few times I used it I had to empty the canister after each room-- which I think just speaks to how awesome this vacuum is! Now that I vacuum weekly (because I love this vacuum so much) I almost fill up the canister just cleaning my 400 square foot apartment.It might not be the best choice for a big house, but for my fellow apartment dwellers, or people without too much carpet I can't recommend it highly enough!"

As you can imagine, I am very picky when cleaning said floors. This little guy works great! Originally purchased to handle the area rugs in our home, I was intrigued by the suction only option and tried it in the kitchen. The fact that it cleaned without shooting dust and filth everywhere, and the roller was truly disengaged (not just raised like some vacs) made me try it on the hardwoods, and boy am I glad I did! It cleaned them in half the time it would take to sweep!I also like that it's so lightweight. My kids can handle it easily, and are now responsible for vacuuming their rooms!The only con could be the lenghth of the cord, but it doesn't bother us as we do have a smaller home, and the easy rinsable filter and bagless dirt canister more than makeup for the shortness of the cord.This vacuum is best for those with small aparrtments/houses, or people who cannot lug around a heavy vac."

I previously had a Eureka bagless -- it was hit or miss and not too effective. However, it was purchased many years ago and they may better now.

The Hoover Nano doesn't require you to purchase filters every 90 days like other vacuums as the filter may be rinsed and set out to dry. I'm extremely satisfied with our choice.The vacuum is perfect for our modest home. It picks up dirt efficiently and it's super easy to empty. It has an indicator on the side that lets us know when to empty the container or rinse the filter. It's multi-surface with a 'suction only' button for bare floors. The handle is detachable, attaches to the hose and acts as a long-reach vacuum for sucking up dust and other debris from hard-to-reach places. The on/off switch is located on the bottom of the vacuum so you simply use your foot to turn it on and off.The only complaint I have is that the dirt compartment is rather small. We have to empty it at least twice when vacuuming just the living room. This may not be an issue for others, but we have a long-haired 75-pound dog who constantly sheds."

Again, I am amazed at what I got for the money. I have had cheap vacuums before (dirt devils, bissels, etc.) that were junk. Got this one as a second vacuum for the kids to use in their rooms upstairs (tired of lugging my other one upstairs -- or not lugging it upstairs, so that the floors never get cleaned!).PROS: This little machine was $50 at Walmart and  is cyclonic, bagless. Very small and light. The roller motor can be turned off for bare floors, which I have a lot of. Not a typical feature in a low price vac. Does a pretty good job on the hard floors and a better job on the carpet. But a better job on the hard floors than any other vac. I've had since my Oreck (which didn't do so great on carpet, and had a roller motor I COULDN'T turn off). Dirt compartment opens easily: trap door at bottom of removable canister that opens with the touch of a finger. So you can just hold the cannister well into your trashcan, open trap door, and let the stuff fall in. No 'poof' of dirt from yanking open a tight compartment from the top (like I've experienced with other bagless machines).CONS: Short cord, and the hose requires 2 hands to assemble for use. Not a deal-breaker for me because of what I paid. You really wouldn't expect a machine of this size and weight to have a super-long cord anyway."

I hope Amazon ends up stocking this vacuum and competes against Walmart as I would have gladly bought this item from Amazon if it had been available. However, buying it at Walmart did have the slight advantage of being able to see the vacuum in person before purchasing.PROS:The suction on this vacuum is quite strong for the size. The cyclonic makes it pretty much suck as well as any other 12A vacuum I think I've ever used in the past.Very lightweight vacuum (less than 12 lbs as advertised) as I'm not a strong guy but I can pick this thing up with one hand which is great because my house is a 3-floor townhouse with a lot of stairs. If my mom's vacuum ever breaks, I know what vacuum I'm having her buy as a replacement. Heck Mother's day is coming up.The handle is used as part of the extension of the vacuum hose so you don't need to have an addition part/piece that you might lose. everything is on-board.Very easy to clean-out, dyson style one-button push bottom empty canister.The brush attachment even works with my Eureka 71B Hand-Held Vacuum to make a great combination.Even with a 1 year warranty, you can buy one of these each year for 5 years and still end up paying less than a Dyson. That's a better warranty than having one vacuum with a 5 year warranty.CONS:The vacuum cord is very short. Its fine if you vacuum one room but you do need to keep unplugging and replugging into another wall socket a bit too often. Or buy an extension cord but having to remember to grab that each would be a minor annoyance.Knowing to push down with your foot rather than having a button or lever was a little weird and took me a bit to figure out.8/13/2011 UPDATEI just used this vacuum again today and figured I would do an update on my review. It's been around 3 months now and this vacuum has still been worth every penny spent. I'm quit glad I purchased this at Walmart and I hope in the future amazon will be able to compete on the price. This vacuum is still great and covers everything I need for my house, is light-weight, has very good suction, and reminds me each time I use it how glad I didn't buy a Dyson for like 8 times the price.I've been able to figure out that for the small problem of the cord sometimes getting in the way while vacuuming that there is a small hook under the handle to keep the cord out of the way so that I don't have to keep grabbing the cord.The bagless cyclonic keeps the dust and dirt from getting out and I have not had any issues with feeling like I was breathing or smelling anything from vacuuming.I still wish there was a lever for pulling the handle back to vacuum but the little foot icon is a good reminder that I just remember to hold it down when needed and it is sturdy enough where it hasn't caused any concerns.If you are at all on the fence just go to Walmart's site to check out the 80 plus positive reviews."

It seems we're replacing vacuums about every 9-15 months!  And we only have two area rugs, I don't get it.  Anyway, I was looking for something inexpensive, lightweight without a bunch of stupid attachments that would fall off/get lost and were difficult to switch back and forth.  This vacuum is very lightweight but does an excellent job.  The hose wraps around the back/bottom like many vacuums do but the handle actually pops right off (a little latch holds it in place, very easy to un-latch with one hand) so you can slide it off and snap it right on to the hose for quick crumb/upholstery/baseboard cleaning.  I also like that the extender latches on with on-hand latch, all of the other vacuum cleaners I've had, you would just slide the extender on and they would fall off many times, every annoyingThis also has the power button that you operate with your foot, step on to turn it on, step on again to turn it off, simple.There is another button that you step on with your foot to make it so you can sweep your hardwood/laminate/tile/whatever floors without the brush spinning, just the suction.  I really like that, I've found with brush cleaners, the brush would grind against the floor (so much for auto-adjusting) and fling the bigger stuff back under the vacuum and at my feet.  This one doesn't do that at all.  We have dogs, cats and kids and just on my first run-through I swept two area rugs with popcorn kernels, dog hair and heaven only knows what, all of it came up without a problem.  Then I ran it under the kitchen table, sucked the cheerios up with no problems and grabbed the dust bunnies right out from under the sideboard.  It doesn't lie completely flat for getting under the sofa/tables, but it comes pretty close.It's very lightweight, I am  able to hold it with one hand and use the hose part with the other to get the steps.The only negative I have with it is that it has a shorter cord than I'm used to.  Easy enough fix with an extension cord, but something to mention.There are two sponge-type filters that say they can be cleaned with water and one that looks like it may also be able to be sprayed off with water, and of course - no bags, so the only things you'd have to replace on this would be if you broke the belt (or when the belt eventually stretches out like it does with all vacuum cleaners). I priced the replacement at the store, it was about $4.  The dirt container is very simple to take off to empty and snaps right back on, it's also light weight but sturdy.So, for right now, this is a great vacuum, it only cost me fifty bucks (plus tax) at Walmart.  I will update this review should there be any issues that pop up or if I discover anything else that I really love about it."
