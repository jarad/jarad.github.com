### Statistics Graduate Minors

A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a Masters Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-master%E2%80%99s-students) requires 5870, 
5880, and at least one other 3-credit 5000-level or above STAT course. 
A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a PhD Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-phd-students) requires 5870, 5880, and at least 2 other 3-credit 5000-level or above STAT courses.

### Course renumbering

The course numbers and names below may have "->" for the course number and 
course name. The course number/name before "->" is current for Spring 2025 while
the course number/name after "->" will be the number/name starting in Fall 2025.
For example, STAT 5870 Statistical Methods for Researcher workers will be
renamed/renumbered to STAT 5101 Statistical Methods for Data Analysis starting
in Fall 2025.

The courses that have not renumbered and renamed will likely be renumbered and
renamed starting in Fall 2026. 
I will try to keep this page current, but the 
[courses page](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/courses) on the 
Statistics Department website will also have updated and former numbers.

You may talk to other graduate students or faculty, e.g. DOGEs, who remember
and refer to even older numbers. 
These numbers are listed on the 
[departmental courses page](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/courses).
For example, STAT 5870 was previously STAT 587 and before that STAT 401. 


### [Next courses](http://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/)

Statistics courses are listed on 
[the University Course Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/), 
but I have pulled out those courses that are likely to be of interest to 
graduates of STAT 5870.

- STAT 5880 ->  5147 - Statistical Theory for Research Workers -> Statistical Theory for Data Analysis
  - STAT 5740 -> 5219 - Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis -> Bayesian Data Analysis
  - STAT 5780 - Introduction to Stochastic Process Models
  - STAT 5760 - Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis
  - STAT 5330 - Reliability
- STAT 5710 -> 5212 - Introduction to Experimental Design -> Experimental Design and Data Analysis
- STAT 5720 -> 5215 - Introduction to Time Series -> Time Series Data Analysis
- STAT 5730 - Introduction to Survey Sampling
- STAT 5750 - Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis (matrix algebra)
- STAT 5770 - Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis
- STAT 5840 - Computer Processing of Scientific Data
- STAT 5850 -> 5585 - Data Technologies for Statistical Analysis
- STAT 5860 -> 5279 - Introduction to Statistical Computing -> Statistical Computing for Data Analysis

Specialty courses:
- STAT 5340 - Ecological Statistics
- STAT 5360 - Statistical Genetics
- STAT 5810 - Analysis of Gene Expression Data for the Biological Sciences

### Courses for Statistics Graduate Students

In the course description, in the course catalog, 
you should look for courses that say 
"May not be used for graduate credit in the Statistics MS and PhD degree programs" 
as these courses are meant for non-statistics graduate students.
If the description does not include this phrase, 
then you will be taking the course with statistics graduate students and
you should expect the course to be more mathematically rigorous.

### Prerequisites

In Fall 2024, graduate courses lost all of their prerequisites due to the 
Workday transition. 
Nonetheless, instructors of Statistics courses expect you to have taken the 
prerequisite courses. 
The prerequisite for all the courses above is STAT 5870/5101. 
In addition, the indentation under STAT 5880/5147 indicates that those 
courses have STAT 5880/5147 as a prerequisite.
