### [Next courses](http://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/)

A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a Masters Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-master%E2%80%99s-students) requires 5870, 
5880, and at least one other 3-credit 5000-level or above STAT course. 
A [minor in Statistics for an individual in a PhD Program](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistics-minor-phd-students) requires 587, 5880, and at least 2 other 3-credit 5000-level or above STAT courses.

Statistics courses are listed on 
[the University Course Catalog](https://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/stat/), 
but I have pulled out those courses that are likely to be of interest to 
graduates of STAT 5870.

- STAT 5880 - Statistical Theory for Research Workers
  - STAT 4740/5740 - Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis
  - STAT 4780/5780 - Introduction to Stochastic Process Models
  - STAT 4760/5760 - Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis
  - STAT 5330 - Reliability
- STAT 4710/5710 - Introduction to Experimental Design 
- STAT 4720/5720 - Introduction to Time Series
- STAT 4730/5730 - Introduction to Survey Sampling
- STAT 4750/5750 - Introduction to Multivariate Data Analysis (matrix algebra)
- STAT 4770/5770 - Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis
- STAT 4840/5840 - Computer Processing of Scientific Data
- STAT 4860/5860 - Introduction to Statistical Computing

Specialty courses:
- STAT 534 - Ecological Statistics
- STAT 536 - Statistical Genetics
- STAT 581 - Analysis of Gene Expression Data for the Biological Sciences

In the course description, in the course catalog, 
you should look for courses that say 
"May not be used for graduate credit in the Statistics MS and PhD degree programs" 
as these courses are meant for non-statistics graduate students.
If the description does not include this phrase, 
then you will be taking the course with statistics graduate students.
