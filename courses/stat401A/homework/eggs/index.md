I collected the amphipod crustacean (<emph>Platorchestia platensis</emph>) on a beach near Stony Brook, Long Island, in April, 1987, removed and counted the number of eggs each female was carrying, then freeze-dried and weighed the mothers. Summary statistics are provided in the table below. 


|variable  |n |mean|sd  |
|----------|--|----|----|
|Weight(mg)|28|6.71|1.16|
|Eggs      |28|23.4|4.11|
|----------|--|----|----|


Using the summary statistics and the correlation between weight (mg) and number of eggs which is estimated to be 0.45. Calculate the following quantities:

- Intercept (\\(\beta_0\\))
- Slope (\\(\beta_1\\))
- Variance (\\(\sigma^2\\))
- \\(R^2\\)
- 95% two-sided confidence interval for \\(\beta_0\\)
- 95% two-sided confidence interval for \\(\beta_1\\)
