This question comes from the [Handbook of Biological Statistics](http://www.biostathandbook.com/).

![Breeding horseshoe crabs](http://www.ecodelaware.com/images/uploadedImages/destinationImage_357_Horseshoe-Crabs---DSCN0212.jpg)

Volunteers count the number of breeding horseshoe crabs on beaches on Delaware Bay every year; [here are the counts from 2011 and 2012](horseshoe_crab.csv). The biological question is whether the number of horseshoe crabs has gone up or down between 2011 and 2012. Please write up your findings similar to the 'Statistical Conclusion' sections of the case studies in The Statistical Sleuth.
