A scientist collected amphipod crustacean (*Platorchestia platensis*) on a beach near Stony Brook, Long Island, in April, 1987. The scientist removed and counted the number of eggs each female was carrying, and then freeze-dried and weighed the mothers. Summary statistics are provided in the table below. 


|variable  |n |mean|sd  |
|----------|--|----|----|
|Weight(mg)|28|6.71|1.16|
|Eggs      |28|23.4|4.11|
|----------|--|----|----|


Using the summary statistics and the correlation between weight (mg) and number of eggs which is estimated to be 0.45. Treating eggs as the response and weight as the explanatory variable, calculate the following quantities:

- Intercept (\\(\beta_0\\))
- Slope (\\(\beta_1\\))
- Variance (\\(\sigma^2\\))
- \\(R^2\\)
- 95% two-sided confidence interval for \\(\beta_0\\)
- 95% two-sided confidence interval for \\(\beta_1\\)
