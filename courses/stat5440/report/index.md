The major culmination of STAT 544 is the final project report. 
This report is a data analysis performed from a Bayesian perspective typically 
using either JAGS or Stan to perform the computation. 
This page is designed to provide guidance for the report.



## Rubric

To aid in providing uniform grading, 
I have developed a [rubric](report_rubric.html) for grading the report.
This rubric provides 10 points for each of the following 10 categories:
on-time, length, grammar, design, clarity, figure(s), table(s), math, 
accuracy, and Bayesian. The rubric provides information for each of these 
categories. The main point is that the report needs to be clear, concise, and 
complete with less emphasis on a perfect statistical analysis.

## Example reports

Previous students with high equality reports have agreed to make their reports
available for future students as an example:

- [A Bayesian approach to estimate time of maximal ``greenness'' in Tropical Evergreen India](examples/greenness.pdf)
- [Analysis of crash frequency using hierarchical negative binomial model with a Bayesian approach](examples/crash.pdf)
- [Investigating effect of recruiting on team success in NCAA football](examples/football.pdf)
- [A story of comeback in ATP tennis tour](examples/tennis.pdf)

## Outline

You will find that these reports follow a consistent outline with the following
sections:

- Introduction
- Data
- Methods 
- Results 
- Discussion

Although you do not need to follow [this outline](outline.html), 
providing a similar structure will help the flow of the manuscript.
