\frametitle{Population vs sample}

\begin{definition}
A \alert{population} is any entire collection of objects we are interested in
and would like to make statements about.
\end{definition}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

\begin{definition}
A \alert{sample} is a group of units selected from the population.
\end{definition}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause 

{\tiny Modified from \url{http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/steps/glossary/basic_definitions.html}}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause 

Our typical goal as scientists and engineers is to take a sample to make a 
statement about the population.

Examples of populations

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

\begin{itemize}
\item all labs in the world
\item all iPhone 5s
\item all diamonds bits for machine cutting
\item all watersheds in Iowa
\item $\vdots$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause 

\alert{What are some examples of populations from your research?}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inference to this population}

\begin{definition}
An \alert{inference} is a conclusion that patterns in the data are present in 
some broader context.
\end{definition}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

Remark:
A (statistically valid) \alert{inference to a population} can be drawn from a 
random sample from that population, 
but not otherwise.

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

\begin{definition}
A \alert{simple random sample} of size $n$ from a population is a subset of the 
population consisting of $n$ members selected in such a way that every subset of 
size $n$ is afforded the same chance of being selected.
\end{definition}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Randomized experiments vs observational studies}

\small

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Randomized experiments vs observational studies}

\begin{definition}
An \alert{experimental unit} is the object which is actually studied by a 
researcher; 
the basic objects upon which measurements are taken.
\end{definition}

\pause

\begin{definition}
An \alert{experiment} is any process or study which results in the collection of 
data, 
the outcome of which is unknown. 
\pause 
A \alert{randomized experiment} is an experiment where the investigator controls 
the assignment of experimental units to groups and uses a {\bf chance mechanism} 
to make the assignment. 
\pause
In an \alert{observational study}, 
the group status of the subjects is not controlled by the investigator.
\end{definition}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause 

Remark:
Statistical inference of \alert{cause-and-effect} relationships can be drawn 
from randomized experiments, 
but not from observational studies.

\frametitle{ZMapp therapy for Ebola}

{\tiny Current Ebola status: \url{http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/guinea/}

\vspace{0.1in}

from: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZMapp}

\begin{quotation}
In 2014, Samaritan's Purse worked with the FDA and Mapp Biopharmaceutical to make the drug available to two of its health workers, who were infected by Ebola during their work in Liberia, under the Expanded access program. At the time, there were only a few doses of ZMapp in existence. According to news reports, Kent Brantly received the first dose of ZMapp nine days after falling ill. According to Samaritan's Purse, Brantly received a blood transfusion from a 14-year old boy who survived an Ebola virus infection before being treated with the ZMapp serum. Nancy Writebol, working alongside Brantly, was also treated with Zmapp. The condition of both health workers improved, especially in Brantly's case, before being transported back to the United States, to Emory University Hospital, specialized for Ebola treatment. Writebol and Brantly were released from hospital on August 21, 2014. \\ 

A Roman Catholic priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, was flown back to Spain from Monrovia on 7 August after being infected with Ebola. With the permission of Spainâ€™s drug safety agency, he was given ZMapp. He died on August 12, two days after receiving the drug. \\

The west African nation of Liberia, which has been affected by the 2014 outbreak, has secured enough ZMapp to treat three individual Liberians with the disease. One of the three to receive the drug, Dr. Abraham Borbor, a Liberian doctor and deputy chief physician at Liberia's largest hospital, died August 25th, 2014. \\ 

William Pooley, a British male nurse who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, was also treated with ZMapp in August 2014.

\frametitle{Uncertainty/Randomness}

\begin{definition}
\alert{Uncertainty} is a lack of certainty, a state of having limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe current state or future outcome, (or the existence of more than one possible outcome).

\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item The hardness measurement for a particular cubic boron nitride sample.
\item Time until failure of a system component.
\item The brightness of a light on an electrical circuit.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Probability and Statistics}

We want to study physical processes that are not completely deterministic. Using probability and statistics to understand the random components of such processes can help us do this. \pause

\vspace{0.2in}

\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Probability}: mathematical theory for modeling \emph{data} where outcomes occur randomly. \pause
\item \alert{Statistics}: use data to make inferences about questions of interest
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2in} \pause

Because statistical inference makes use of probability models, 
probability is a foundation for statistics.
