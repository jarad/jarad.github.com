{\Large Model comparisons}

\item An unreplicated completely randomized block design (CRBD) experiment is 
being designed to study the effect of laser etching on hardness of Boron 
Nitride.
The experiment has 2 blocks, 3 levels of laser intensity, and 4 levels of laser
speed. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete the degrees of freedom portion of the following ANOVA table.
(12 points)

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
{\Large
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
\hline
Factor & df \\
\hline
Block & \\
Intensity & \\
Speed & \\
Intensity:Speed & \\
Error & \\

\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}
\begin{answer}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
{\Large
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
\hline
Factor & df \\
\hline
Block & 1\\
Intensity & 2\\
Speed & 3\\
Intensity:Speed & 6\\
Error & 11\\
\hline
Total & 23\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}
\end{answer}

\item The following table provides residual sums-of-squares for a sequence of 
nested models.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccc|r}
\hline
\multicolumn{4}{c|}{Term included} & \\
Block & Intensity & Speed & Intensity:Speed & SSE \\
\hline
% X &   &   &   &   & 55 \\
X &   &   &   & 55 \\
X & X &   &   & 43 \\
X & X & X &   & 30 \\
X & X & X & X & 8 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Conduct an $F$-test to compare the model with Block to the model that 
includes Block, Intensity, Speed, and the interaction between Intensity and 
Speed. Report the numerator
and denominator degrees of freedom, estimate for $\hat\sigma^2$, $F$-statistic, 
$p$-value, and an interpretation for the test. (8 points)

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
n_df = 11 # 2+3+6
d_df = 11 # error degrees of freedom
SSE_full = 8
SSE_reduced = 55
sigma2 = 8/11 # SSE for full model/error degrees of freedom
Fstat = (SSE_reduced-SSE_full)/n_df/sigma2; Fstat
p = 1-pf(Fstat,n_df,d_df); p
@
\[F_{11,11} = \frac{(55-8)/11}{8/11} = \Sexpr{Fstat}\]
\[p=P(F_{11,11} > \Sexpr{Fstat}) = 1-P(F_{11,11} < \Sexpr{Fstat}) = \Sexpr{p}\]

The data are incompatible with the null model which is the regression model 
whose mean only includes block.
If we believe the other regression model assumptions, i.e. independent errors,
normal errors, and errors with constant variance, then we should improve the 
mean structure by including intensity, speed, their interaction, or some 
combination of these.

\item The file \texttt{hydrocarbons.csv} is a \texttt{csv} version of the data set 
found at \url{http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/regression/x14.txt}.
Use the following code to fit a main effects model:
<<message=FALSE>>=
d = read.csv("hydrocarbons.csv")
m = lm(Hydrocarbons.escaping..grams. ~ ., data = d)
@
Answer the following questions based on this model fit.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of the following regression assumptions, state whether the 
assumption is reasonably met and state what your evidence for this conclusion. 
As an example, for the linearity (mean structure) assumption, you 
might say 
\begin{quote}
The linearity assumption is reasonably met based on no curvature observed in 
scatterplots of residuals vs each individual explanatory variable.
\end{quote}
(5 points each)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Normality

\begin{answer}
The linearity assumption appears reasonably met according to the normal qq-plot.
There is some slight evidence of heavy-tailed errors, but nothing too concerning.
\end{answer}
\vfill

\item Constant variance

\begin{answer}
The constant variance assumption appears reasonably met according to the plot 
of residuals vs fitted values (no shotgun pattern) and the absolute residuals
vs fitted values or scale-location plot (smoothing line is reasonably straight).
\end{answer}
\vfill

\item Independence

\begin{answer}
Independence is hard to evaluate. Plotting the residuals vs index which may give
an indication of a temporal pattern in the errors may show reduced variability
for residuals with a low index compared to residuals with a higher index. 
This would actually be a violation of the constant variance assumption.
No clear pattern is observed in the residuals and therefore there is no clear
evidence that the independence assumption is violated.
\end{answer}
\vfill

\end{enumerate}

\item Explain why the observation in line 18 has high leverage. (5 points)

\begin{answer}
An observation has high leverage when the explanatory variables are far from
the explanatory variables for the other observations.
Observation 18 has tank temperature of 90F which is almost the maximum in the 
data set, initial tank pressure of 7.32psi which is close to the maximum, 
petrol pressure of 7.2psi which is also close to the maximum, and petrol 
temperature of 60F which is close to the 3rd quartile. 
These values are all on the high end compared to the other observations and 
thus give observation 18 high leverage.
