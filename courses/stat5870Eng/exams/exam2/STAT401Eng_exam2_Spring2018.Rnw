\begin{enumerate}

\item Please answer the following questions using your own words. 
If I find that you have copied your answers from the internet, 
you will receive a 0.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the population? (5 points)

\begin{answer}
All the units being studied.
\end{answer}
\vfill

\item What is a sample? (5 points)

\begin{answer}
The subset of the population that you actually have data on.
\end{answer}
\vfill

\item For the model $Y_i\stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ name two statistics. (5 points)

\begin{answer}
sample mean ($\overline{y}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) although
there are many others that you could have answered, 
e.g. quantiles
\end{answer}
\vfill

\item Describe what it means for an estimator to be unbiased. (5 points)

\begin{answer}
An estimator $\hat{\theta}$ is unbiased for a population parameter $\theta$ if 
$E[\hat\theta] = \theta$ where the expectation is taken with respect to the data
being random.
\end{answer}

\newpage
\item Iowa State University has a goal that 95\% of PhD Engineering students
are employed full time within 6 months of graduation. 
Of the 69 individuals who graduated in the spring of 2016 with a PhD in 
Engineering, 
67 of those individual were employed full time within 6 months of graduation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State an appropriate model for these data. (5 points)

\begin{answer}
Let $Y$ be the number of employed students. 
Then a reasonable model is $Y\sim Bin(n,\theta)$ where 
$n=69$ and $y=67$.

that the 6-month employment probability is less than or equal to 95\% versus the 
alternative that the 6-month employment probability is greater than 95\%. (5 points)

calculate the posterior probability that the 6-month employment probability
is greater than 95\%. (5 points)

\item A research group at Iowa State believes they have developed a material
just as hard as diamond. 
They tested 9 randomly chosen samples of this material.
The sample average Vickers hardness was 8 Mg/mm$^2$ and the sample standard deviation was 4 Mg/mm$^2$.
Assume the samples are independent, normally distributed with a common mean
and variance.
Also assume the default prior.

Calculate the posterior probability the mean hardness of this material is 
greater than that of diamond. (5 points)

\item The predictive distribution for a new observation $\tilde{Y}$ is 
$\tilde{Y}\sim t_{n-1}(\overline{y}, s^2(1+1/n))$. Calculate the probability 
a new observation is over 10 Mg/mm$^2$. (5 points)

\begin{answer}
\[ \begin{array}{rl}
P(\tilde{Y} > 10) &= P\left( \frac{\tilde{Y}-\overline{y}}{s\sqrt{1+1/n}} > \frac{10-\Sexpr{ybar}}{\Sexpr{s}\sqrt{1+1/\Sexpr{n}}} \right) \\
& = P(T_{n-1} > \Sexpr{(10-ybar)/s/sqrt(1+1/n)}) \\
& = 1 - P(T_{n-1} < \Sexpr{(10-ybar)/s/sqrt(1+1/n)})

\item In an attempt to slow down traffic, police installed a stationary radar
gun with a sign that displays the speed of cars approaching it. 
Prior to placing the sign, 
police randomly selected 100 cars passing that position and recorded 65 cars
in excess of the posted speed limit.

police randomly selected 100 cars passing the same position and recorded 
55 cars in excess of the posted speed limit.
