## Course overview

I think of this course as a regression course for non-statistics graduate 
students. 
Despite the prerequisites, it is common that students in this course have 
little background in probability and statistics. 

A core component of this course 
(and perhaps different from other STAT 587 sections) is understanding Bayesian 
and frequentist approaches to inference so that these students understand the 
difference and can interpret Bayesian analyses in their literature. 
To understand these approaches to inference a background in the basics of 
probability theory is taught. 

### Modules

The course is broken down into 3 modules: probability, inference, and 
regression. The probability module introduces the basics of discrete and 
continuous random variables including the binomial and normal distributions. 
The inference module uses these two distributions to introduce the basics 
of Bayesian and frequentist approaches. 
The regression module then uses these inferential approaches within the context
of simple and multiple linear regression. 
The perspective throughout is on designed experiments rather than observational
studies.

## TA expectations

In Fall 2024, two TAs were assigned to the course: one for 20 hrs/week and the
other for 10 hrs/week. 
The times below are indicated for the 20 hrs/week TA. 
Times for the 10 hrs/week TA can (for the most part) be determined by dividing
the time in half. 

|Task        | 20hr TA | 10 hr TA|
|------------|---------|---------|
|Preparation | 2       | 2       |
|Office Hours| 2       | 1       |
|Lab         | 0       | 0       |
|Homework    | 5?      | 2       |
|Exams       | 1       | 1       |
|Discussion  | 2       | 2       |
|Meeting     | 1       | 1       |
|------------|---------|---------|
|Total       |13       | 9       |

### Preparation

This is making sure you are up to date on the material being taught that week
and the manner in which it is being taught. 
You are expected to look through pdf versions of the slides, 
assigned reading, and videos (perhaps on a faster speed). 


### Office hours 

TAs and the Instructor will hold weekly office hours 
(2 hours for the Instructor and 2 hours for a 20 hr/week TA). 
The first week of class the Instructor will send a poll to students to determine
when students are available for office hours. 
In consultation with the Instructor, TAs will determine office hours based on

1. their coursework and other responsibilities,
1. student availability, and
1. closeness to homework due date 
(Mondays when lab is on Thursday and Friday(?) when lab is on Tuesday).

### Lab

The 2-hour weekly lab in this course generally has two components:
1) lecture material on R code and 2) student work time. 
The TA (20 hr/week TAs specifically) must attend lab to answer student questions.

There may also be lab assignments graded by the Gradescope Autograder. 
The Instructor will provide the TA with lab assignments and the TA will 
write code to complete the assignment and submit to the Autograder. 

Lab time is also used for the two mid-semester exams. 

### Homework

Student homework will be submitted as a pdf file to Gradescope. 
Instructor will provide homework solutions as well as the homework questions
assigned to each TA. 
TAs will grade the assignments within 1 week of homework deadline. 

### Exams

There will be 3 exams in the course: one around week 5, another around week 10,
and the final during the final exam period. 
Each exam covers only the material from that module. 

TAs should be prepared to take the exam as if they were a student and provide
their solutions to the Instructor. 
With their solutions, they should report to the Instructor if any question was
unclear. 
The Instructor will use the TAs solutions as a gauge on how clear the questions
were and also as a check on the solutions the Instructor has prepared. 

TAs should also be prepared to grade the exam shortly after the exam is given, 
i.e. typically within 24 hours. 
Since exams (except the final) are given in lab on Tuesday/Thursday,
the Instructor will designate a grading time for all to gather and grade at
one time. 
Typically this grading session can be completed in 2 hours. 


### Discussion

The Canvas Discussion board is heavily used in this course.
In fact, the Instructor will tell students to submit questions to the Discussion
board rather than emailing the Instructor or TA. 
The Instructor will also tell students that if they email, 
the Instructor will post the question to the Discussion board anyway. 
It is in the student's best interests to submit to the Discussion board rather
than emailing because their question may be answered much quicker since there
are many more people who could answer including Instructor, TAs, and other
students. 

TAs should regularly check the Canvas Discussion board to answer student 
questions. 

### Meetings
  
The Instructor and TAs will meet weekly to Discuss course developments. 
This meeting will likely not last a full hour. 

  
## TA To Do

Create github.com account and accept invitation to [STAT587EngPrivate](https://github.com/jarad/STAT587EngPrivate) 
repository.

I suggest you also set up your system to use 
[R/RStudio and Git/GitHub](https://www.jarad.me/teaching/2017/08/31/getting-started-with-R-and-Git-GitHub.html).
