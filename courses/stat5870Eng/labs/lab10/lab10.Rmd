## ANOVA Table

To run an ANOVA in R, use the `anova()` function on an `lm` object. 

```{r}
m <- lm(Lifetime ~ Diet, data = case0501)
anova(m)
```

Note a few things about this table:

- It provides an organization for the F-test.
- The coefficient of determination is 12734/(12734+15297).
- There are 6 diets (Df+1).
- There are 349 observations (sum(Df)+1). 

This F-test also shows up in the R regression output:

```{r}
summary(m)
```

where the last line provides the F-statistic, the numerator and denominator 
degrees of freedom, and the associated p-value. 
The two models being compared here are the intercept-only model and the model
with all explanatory variables (in this case the indicator functions for all
but one Diet). 

This F-test can be constructed manually by fitting these two models and using
the `anova()` function to compare the models. 

```{r}
m0 <- lm(Lifetime ~ 1, data = case0501) # 1 indicates intercept 
anova(m0, m)
```

This table contains the information from the intercept-only model in row 1 and 
the information from the model with Diet, as a categorical variable, in row 2. 



#### Activity

The `ex0920` data set contains information on the Kentucky Derby winners from
1896-2011.

1. Fit a multiple regression model of Speed on Starters and the 7 level version of Track conditions.
1. Verify that the F-statistic in the `summary()` output of this multiple 
regression model compares the intercept-only model with the model with all 
of the explanatory variables. 

Bonus 

1. After completing this, take a look at the ANOVA table on the regression model 
and see if you can figure out what the different lines represent.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
m0 <- lm(Speed ~ 1,                data = ex0920)
m  <- lm(Speed ~ Starters + Track, data = ex0920)
summary(m)
anova(m0, m)
```

Now take a look at the ANOVA table

```{r, purl=FALSE}
anova(m)
```

### ANOVA with multiple explanatory variables

The ANOVA table when multiple explanatory variables are included differs from
our one-way ANOVA table.

```{r}
m <- lm(Speed ~ Starters + Track, data = ex0920)
anova(m)
```

To determine what full and reduced models are used in constructing this ANOVA 
table, we will fit a variety of different models.

```{r}
m0  <- lm(Speed ~ 1,                data = ex0920)
mS  <- lm(Speed ~ Starters,         data = ex0920)
mT  <- lm(Speed ~            Track, data = ex0920)
mST <- lm(Speed ~ Starters + Track, data = ex0920)
```

You might think the ANOVA table compares 

1. intercept-only model to the model with Starters
2. the Starters model to the Starters+Track model

```{r}
anova(m0, mS ) # we are looking to add (S)tarters to the model
anova(mS, mST) # we are looking to add (T)rack    to the model
```

We get identical results for the second comparison but not for the first. 

The reason is what estimate of the error variance, $\hat\sigma^2$, is used.
If the models are all put together, then the error variance estimate is based 
on the fullest model in the list.
So the following will recreate the full ANOVA table.

```{r}
anova(m0, mS, mST)
```

This method is more powerful than the comparing models one at a time and is 
therefore preferred.

#### Activity

1. Recreate the following ANOVA table by fitting each model separately and using
the `anova()` function to recreate the models. 

Bonus: 

1. 
why is Df only 5 for the interaction?

```{r}
m  <- lm(Speed ~ Track*Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
anova(m)
```

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary> 

We need to construct each model:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
m0  <- lm(Speed ~ 1, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
mT  <- lm(Speed ~ Track         , data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
mTS <- lm(Speed ~ Track+Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
m   <- lm(Speed ~ Track*Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
```

Then we use `anova()` to compare the models:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
anova(m0, mT, mTS, m)
```
</details>


### Dropping one term

The previous ANOVA table is often referred to as a sequential, or Type I, sum of
squares because the tests are sequential, e.g. 

1. should we add Track?
1. should we add Starters (in addition to Track)?
1. should we add the interaction between Track and Starters (in addition to 
Track and Starters)?

Often times we are interested in whether terms should be dropped from the full
model. 

In this situation, we always have a consistent full model and we are only 
considering dropping a particular explanatory variable. 
For example, consider the Kentucky Derby data with main effects for Track and 
Starters and we want to consider dropping Track or dropping Starters. 

```{r}
m <- lm(Speed ~ Track + Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
drop1(m, test="F")
```

Here the full model is the model with both Track and Starters. 
There is a different reduced model for each line:

- Track line has the reduced model that has no Track explanatory variable.
- Starters line has the reduced model that has no Starters explanatory variable.

So it is equivalent to the following two comparisons:

```{r}
mT  <- lm(Speed ~ Track,            data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
mS  <- lm(Speed ~         Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
mST <- lm(Speed ~ Track + Starters, data = Sleuth3::ex0920)
anova(mS,mST) # Consider adding Track into the model that already has Starters
anova(mT,mST) # Consider adding Starters into the model that already has Track
```

#### Activity - Recreating ANOVA table

Recreate the following `drop1()` results:

```{r}
m <- lm(Ingestion ~ Weight + Organic, data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
drop1(m, test='F')
```

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>  
```{r, purl=FALSE}
mW  <- lm(Ingestion ~ Weight          , data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
mO  <- lm(Ingestion ~          Organic, data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
mWO <- lm(Ingestion ~ Weight + Organic, data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
anova(mO,mWO)
anova(mW,mWO)
```
</details>


### Including interactions

When interactions are considered, 
there is a *rule of thumb* that says that if an interaction is in the model, 
you should keep the main effects in the model. 
Thus, when you run drop1 on models with an interaction, 
it will only attempt to drop the interaction.


```{r}
m <- lm(Ingestion ~ Weight * Organic, data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
drop1(m, test = 'F')
```
It is not obvious from this output that you are comparing the model that
contains the main effects with the model that additional adds the interaction.
You can check this with the `anova` function.

```{r}
m0 <- lm(Ingestion ~ Weight + Organic, data = Sleuth3::ex0921)
anova(m0,m)
```

Notice that the statistics are all the same as the `drop1` results.

## Model construction strategy

When constructing a model, follow these prioritized rules

1. Include explanatory variables that are part of the design.
1. Include explanatory variables that answer questions of scientific interest.
1. Include lower order terms, e.g. main effects when interactions are present and 
linear terms when quadratic terms are present.
1. Include ``significant'' explanatory variables.

In particular, do NOT remove insignificant design variables.
