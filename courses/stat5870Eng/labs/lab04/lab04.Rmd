# Purpose: Graphical statistics using ggplot2 (included in tidyverse)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

## Setup

### Install package

```{r install-tidyverse, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If the install fails, then run

```{r install-packages-individually, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr","tidyr","ggplot2"))
```

### Load packages

The installation only needs to be done once. 
But we will need to load the packages in every R session where we want to use 
them.
To load the packages, use 

```{r load-packages, eval=FALSE}
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("ggplot2")
```

alternatively, you can load the entire (not very big) `tidyverse`.

```{r load-tidyverse}
library("tidyverse")
```

Change theme to a better one

```{r theme-bw}
theme_set(theme_bw()) # comment this line to see what default plots look like
```

## Constructing plots

The main purpose of the lab today is to construct plots using the `ggplot2`
R package.
In order to construct these plots, 
we need to construct an appropriate `data.frame` and we will use 
`dplyr` to help us construct that `data.frame`. 




Let's use the built-in R data set `airquality`.
Before we start plotting let's take a quick look at the data.

```{r data}
# Summary statistics
dim(airquality)
head(airquality)
tail(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

For built in datasets, 
we can get more information by going to the help file.

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
?airquality
```

One issue with this dataset is that the Month/Day columns don't really provide 
us with a `Date`.
Let's create a new column that creates a real `Date`.

```{r mutate}
airquality <- airquality %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Date = as.Date(paste("1973",Month,Day,sep="/"))) 
```

If you deal with dates a lot, 
you should check out the [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate) 
package.

### Histogram

All `ggplot2` graphics require a `data.frame` containing the data
and this `data.frame` is always the first argument to a `ggplot` 
call.
After this, we specify some aesthetics using the `aes()` function.
Then, we tell `ggplot2` what kind of graphics to construct.

```{r histogram}
ggplot(airquality,     # data.frame containing the data
       aes(x=Ozone)) + # a column name from the data.frame
  geom_histogram()     # create a histogram
```

If you want to avoid the message, 
you can specify the number of bins to use.

```{r histogram-bins}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x=Ozone)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40)
```

If you want plot on the density scale 
(so that you can compare to a pdf),
use the following:


```{r histogram-density}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x=Ozone)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins = 40)
```


#### Histogram activity

Create a histogram of solar radiation on the density scale with 50 bins.

```{r histgram-activity, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x=Solar.R)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), bins = 50)
```
</details>




### Boxplots

The syntax for boxplots is similar except that the variable you are
interest in is the y aesthetic.

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=1,y=Ozone)) + 
  geom_boxplot()     
```

Comparing boxplots

```{r boxplots}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Ozone, group=Month)) + 
  geom_boxplot()     
```


#### Boxplot activity

Create boxplots of wind speed by month.
Bonus: See if you can google to find out how to swap the axes, 
i.e. have Month on the y-axis and Wind on the x-axis.

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>
```{r boxplot-activity, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Wind, group=Month)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, color='grey') +  
  coord_flip()
```

Flipping the axes makes the comparisons vertical and therefore, I think, 
easier to interpret.
</details>



### Scatterplot

At this point we can construct individual graphs for our 4 different response
variables: Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp.
Perhaps we want to understand the temporal variability for Ozone.
We can use a scatterplot of Ozone vs Date.

```{r scatterplot}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Date, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```

or if we wanted a line plot

```{r lineplot}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Date, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_line()
```

Notice that the line is disconnected wherever we have missing data.

Perhaps we want to understand the relationship between solar radiation and 
ozone. 

```{r scatterplot2}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Solar.R, y = Ozone)) +
  geom_point()
```



#### Scatterplot activity

Create a scatterplot of wind speed versus temperature.


<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>
```{r scatterplot-activity, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Temp, y = Wind)) +
  geom_point()
```
</details>



### Boxplots with scatterplots

Scatterplots don't look so good when there are data points that overlap. 
For example, when plotting Ozone vs Month the points may overlap due to Month
only having 5 values in the data set.

```{r scatterplot-by-month}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Ozone, group=Month)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

So, instead we will typically jitter the points a bit to remove the overlap, 
e.g.

```{r jitterplot}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Ozone, group=Month)) + 
  geom_jitter() 
```

Now, we can combine the boxplots we discussed earlier with scatterplots or 
jittered scatterplots, e.g. 

```{r boxplot-scatterplot}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Ozone, group=Month)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color='grey',                 # make the boxes not so obvious
               outlier.shape = NA) +         # remove outliers, 
  geom_point()                               # because they get plotted here
```

or 

```{r boxplot-jitterplot}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Ozone, group=Month)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color='grey',                 # make the boxes not so obvious
               outlier.shape = NA) +         # remove outliers, 
  geom_jitter()                              # because they get plotted here
```


#### Boxplot with scatterplot activity

Create a scatterplot of wind speed by month and add a boxplot for each month
in the background.

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>
```{r boxplot-scatterplot-activity, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(airquality,     
       aes(x=Month, y=Wind, group=Month)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, color='grey') +         
  geom_jitter() + 
  coord_flip()
```

Flipping the axes makes the comparisons vertical and therefore, I think, 
easier to interpret.

### Converting data.frame from wide to long

If we want to put all the response variables on the same plot, we can color 
them.
In order to do this, we will need to organize our `data.frame` into long format. 

```{r pivot-longer}
airquality_long <- airquality %>%
  dplyr::select(-Month, -Day) %>%              # Remove these columns
  tidyr::pivot_longer(-Date,
                      names_to  = "response",
                      values_to = "value")
```

Take a look at the resulting `data.frame`.

```{r airquality-long-summary}
dim(airquality)
dim(airquality_long)

head(airquality_long)
summary(airquality_long)
table(airquality_long$response)
```

```{r multiple-lines}
ggplot(airquality_long, 
       aes(x = Date, y = value, 
           linetype = response,
           color = response, 
           group = response)) +
  geom_line()
```

Notice that the legend is automatically created.
This is not something that is done in base R graphics.

Honestly, this doesn't look very good, 
so it is better to facet the plot.



### Faceted scatterplots

Facets are often a better way of representing multiple variables.

```{r facet-wrap}
ggplot(airquality_long, aes(Date, value)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~response)
```

Since the axes are quite different for the different responses, 
we can allow them to vary in the different facets.

```{r facet-wrap-free-y}
ggplot(airquality_long, aes(Date, value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~response,scales="free_y")
```

Alternatively, we can use `facet_grid` which is more useful when you have 
more variables you want to facet by. 

```{r facet-grid-columns}
ggplot(airquality_long, aes(Date, value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(.~response,scales="free_y")
```

or

```{r facet-grid-rows}
ggplot(airquality_long, aes(Date, value)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(response ~ .,scales="free_y")
```


### Converting data.frame from long to wide

If we only had the long version of the `data.frame`, we can reconstruct the
wide version by using the following

```{r pivot-wider}
airquality2 <- airquality_long %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from  = response, 
    values_from = value)
```

### Customizing ggplot2 graphics

Sometimes it is helpful to save the plot as an R object 
so that it can be updated in the future. 
To save the plot, just use the assignment operator, e.g. 

```{r ggplot2-plot-as-an-object}
g <- ggplot(airquality2,
       aes(x = Temp, y = Wind)) +
  geom_point()

g # Then you can see the plot by just typing the object name
```

We would like this plot to be a bit more informative, 
so we will add some informative labels.

```{r ggplot2-add-titles}
g <- g +
  labs(x = "Temperature (F)",
       y = "Wind speed (mph)",
       title = "New York (May-September 1973)")

g
```

As you have seen before, we can also change the theme. 
I prefer the simple "bw" theme, but here is the default theme.

```{r ggplot2-change-theme}
g <- g + theme_classic()
g
```

We can add a regression line.

```{r ggplot2-add-regression-line}
g <- g + geom_smooth(method="lm")
g
```

Alternatively, you can combine all the steps

```{r ggplot2-altogther}
ggplot(airquality2,
       aes(x = Temp, y = Wind)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  labs(x = "Temperature (F)",
       y = "Wind speed (mph)",
       title = "New York (May-September 1973)") 
```



#### Plot creation activity

Use the `cars` dataset to construct and customize a figure displaying the
relationship between the stopping distance and speed of a car.

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary> 
```{r plot-activity, purl=FALSE}
ggplot(cars,
       aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)",
       y = "Stopping distance (ft)",
       title = "Stopping distance as a function of speed (1920s)") 
```
</details>


## Saving ggplot graphics

If you want to save the plot, use the ggsave function, e.g.

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE}
ggsave(filename = "plot.png", 
       plot     = g, 
       width    = 5, 
       height   = 4)
```
