Although R and RStudio will be available in the lab, you will likely want to 
install R and RStudio on your own personal laptop, desktop, or both. 
Below are installation instructions for R and RStudio. 

## Install R (may require administrator privileges)

Please go to <http://www.r-project.org/> and click on 
[download R](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). You will be asked to 
select a [CRAN mirror](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). I select 
<https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/> for obvious reasons. 
In the download and install R section, click on 
the correct link depending on your operating system: Linux, (Mac) OS X, or 
Windows. 

### Windows

Click on **base** and then the link to Download R X.X.X for Windows (where the 
X will be numbers representing the current version of R). Install this program 
like any other program on Windows using all the defaults.

### (Mac) OS X

Click on the appropriate **.pkg** file depending on which version of Mac OS X 
you are using. Install this program like any other program on OS X using all the 
defaults. 

### Linux

If you are using Linux, then I trust you know what you are doing. You can 
install R from source or you can use a package manager. 


## Install RStudio (may require administrator privileges)

The installation of RStudio is optional, but highly recommended. 
It provides an improved interface to R and has 
[projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) 
which help to quickly switch between (oddly enough) projects. 
Go to <http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> and choose the correct 
platform under **Installers for ALL Platforms**. 
Install like any other program. 

Now, whenever you want to run R, just run RStudio.
