Make sure the following package is installed:

- lme4

You can use the following code to perform the installation:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lme4")
```

Now load the packages

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
# library("Sleuth3")
library("lme4")
```

## Generalized linear models

[Generalized linear models] are a class of models that include 

- linear regression
- logistic regression
- Poisson regression

as specific examples.
The `glm()` function allows us to fit all of these models, 
although we usually use the `lm()` function for the special (and important)
case of linear regression.

### Linear regression

The linear regression model can be fit using either the `glm()` or `lm()` 
function, 
but running `summary()` on the `lm()` function analysis is more informative.

```{r}
m_lm  <- lm( Velocity ~ Distance, data = Sleuth3::case0701)
m_glm <- glm(Velocity ~ Distance, data = Sleuth3::case0701)
```

where the default family in the `glm()` function is `normal`.

```{r}
summary(m_lm)
summary(m_glm)
```

The dispersion parameter is the estimate of the variance.



### Logistic regression

Logistic regression can be accomplished using the `glm()` function and 
setting the `family` argument to `binomial`. 
There are two different ways to set up the logistic regression model fit 
depending on whether the data are grouped or not.

#### Ungrouped data

For ungrouped data, the response can be a factor where the first level is 
failure and all other levels are success.

```{r}
levels(Sleuth3::case2002$LC)
m <- glm(LC ~ CD, data = Sleuth3::case2002, family=binomial)
m
```

Thus, this logistic regression analysis has ``success'' being ``NoCancer''. 

It is better practice to be explicit. 
You can be explicit by using an equality and thus treating the response as 
TRUE/FALSE.

```{r}
m <- glm(LC == "LungCancer" ~ CD, 
         data = Sleuth3::case2002, 
         family = binomial)
m
```

Care needs to be taken with this approach because any value other than 
``LungCancer'' will be treated as a failure, e.g. typos. 

Finally, we can use a 0-1 coding where 1 is a success and 0 is failure.

```{r}
d <- Sleuth3::case2002 %>%
  mutate(lung_cancer = 1*(LC == "LungCancer"))
m <- glm(LC == "LungCancer" ~ CD, 
         data = d, 
         family = binomial)
m
```

To obtain a better summary use `summary`(). 

```{r}
summary(m)
```


#### Activity

Fit a logistic regression model to determine the relationship between survival
in the Donner Party (`case2001`) and the age and sex of the individual. 

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>  
```{r, purl=FALSE}
m <- glm(Status == "Survived" ~ Age + Sex,
         data = Sleuth3::case2001,
         family = binomial)
summary(m)
```
</details>



### Grouped data

Often times data are grouped by explanatory variable values.
For example, we can group the lung cancer data set by the number of cigarettes
per day.
The most typical way these data are stored is to have the number of observations
and the proportion of them that were ``successful''. 

```{r}
lung_grouped <- Sleuth3::case2002 %>%
  group_by(CD) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            y = sum(LC == "LungCancer"))

lung_grouped
```

You can still fit the regression model using the `glm()` function, but you 
need to using the `cbind()` function as the response where you have the first
term is the number of successes and the second term is the number of failures.
So the logistic regression model fit looks like.
(Be careful not to use the `c()` function or you will get a ``variable 
lengths differ'' error.)

```{r}
m <- glm(cbind(y,n-y) ~ CD, 
         data = lung_grouped, 
         family = binomial)
summary(m)
```

#### Activity

Group the Donner party data (`Sleuth3::case2001`) by age and sex. 
Then re-run the logistic regression analysis from the previous activity on 
these grouped data.

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>  
```{r, purl=FALSE}
donner_grouped <- Sleuth3::case2001 %>%
  group_by(Age,Sex) %>%
  summarize(y = sum(Status == "Survived"),
         n = n())

m <- glm(cbind(y,n-y) ~ Age + Sex,
         data = donner_grouped,
         family = binomial)

summary(m)
```
</details>



### Poisson regression

To run a Poisson regression in R, use the `glm()` function with the `family` 
argument set to `poisson`. 

```{r}
m <- glm(Matings ~ Age,
         data = Sleuth3::case2201,
         family = poisson)
summary(m)
```

#### Activity

Investigate the relationship between number of salamanders as a function of 
forest age using a Poisson regression analysis. 
Data are available in `Sleuth3::case2202'. 

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary> 
```{r, purl=FALSE}
m <- glm(Salamanders ~ ForestAge, 
         data = Sleuth3::case2202,
         family = poisson)

summary(m)
```
</details>
  
  
## Comparing generalized linear models

To compare nested linear models, we used the F-test through the R function
`anova()`. 
For GLMs, we will use a likelihood ratio test through the same function.
Asymptotically (i.e. as you have infinite data), the statistic for this test 
has a chi-squared distribution. 
Thus, we specify this test using the `anova()` table setting the `test` argument
to "Chi". 

Here is a test to determine whether we should have included an interaction 
between birdkeeping and the number of cigarettes per day.

```{r}
mA <- glm(LC ~ BK + CD, data = Sleuth3::case2002, family = binomial)
mI <- glm(LC ~ BK * CD, data = Sleuth3::case2002, family = binomial)
anova(mA,mI, test="Chi")
```

Note that the title of this table is "Analysis of Deviance" which indicates
you are working with GLMs rather than linear models.
  

#### Activity

Use a likelihood ratio test to determine whether an interaction between Age and
Sex should be included in the logistic regression model of survival probability
in the Donner party.

<details><summary>Click for solution</summary>  
```{r, purl=FALSE}
mA <- glm(Status ~ Age + Sex, data = Sleuth3::case2001, family = binomial)
mI <- glm(Status ~ Age * Sex, data = Sleuth3::case2001, family = binomial)
anova(mA,mI, test="Chi")
```
</details>




## Generalized linear mixed effect models

To fit a mixed effect model in R, use the 
[lme4 package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html).

### Linear mixed effect models

For a linear regression model with random effects, 
use the `lmer`() function.

Here is a random intercept model.

```{r}
library("lme4")
m <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1| Subject), data = sleepstudy)
summary(m)
```

Here is a random slope model

```{r}
m <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days| Subject), data = sleepstudy)
summary(m)
```


### Generalized linear mixed effect models

For any generalized linear model, e.g. logistic and Poisson regression,
you can add random effects using the `glmer()` function.

Random intercept model.

```{r}
m <- glmer(cbind(incidence, size - incidence) ~ period + (1 | herd),
              data = cbpp, family = binomial)
summary(m)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
knitr::knit("lab12.Rmd", tangle = TRUE)
```
