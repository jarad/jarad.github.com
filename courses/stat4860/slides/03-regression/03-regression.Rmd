# Regression

Regression models explain the relationship between a response variable ($Y$)
and a collection of explanatory variables ($X$). 
We use different types of regression models depending on the type of response
variable we have:

- Continuous response $\longrightarrow$ linear regression
- Count (with no maximum) response $\longrightarrow$ Poisson regression
- Count (with a maximum) response $\longrightarrow$ logistic regression
- Binary response $\longrightarrow$ logistic regression

Linear regression (described below) assumes a
[normal (of Gaussian) distribution](../01-probability/01-probability.html#normal) 
for the data (but really the errors). 
Poisson regression assumes a 
[Poisson distribution](../01-probability/01-probability.html#Poisson) 
for the data.  
Logistic regression assumes a 
[binomial distribution](../01-probability/01-probability.html#binomial)  for the data
(or Bernoulli when the response is binary).


Regression models alter a bit depending on the data type of the explanatory 
variables. 
The most natural approach is when the explanatory variable(s) are continuous
because then we can think about the regression model drawing a line through the
data. 
But we have a lot of flexibility on how to include this continuous variable 
in the model including take a logarithm of the variable and squaring the 
variable. 
When the explanatory variables are categorical, 
then we need to construct *dummy* (or *indicator*) variables to include in the 
regression model. 
In addition, 
if we have interaction terms (which we generally think of as multiplying 
explanatory variables), then interpretation of the regression model 
becomes more difficult and nuanced. 


## Simple linear regression

The simple linear regression (SLR) models expands the applicability of normal based
modeling be shifting the mean according to **one explanatory** variable.
I use the terms *response variable* ($Y$) and *explanatory variable* ($X$) to  
identify the variable that explains the change in the response variable. 

To run a simple linear regression model, 
we need to record both the response and explanatory variable for each 
observation, 
i.e. we have a double $(Y_i,X_i)$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$.
Then our model is 
$$Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(\beta_0+\beta_1X_i,\sigma^2).$$
Although this is a succinct way of writing the model, 
I think a more intuitive way to write the model is 
$$Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i, \qquad \epsilon_i\stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2).$$
This notation more directly provides the 4 assumptions in a simple linear 
regression model:

- independent errors
- normal errors
- errors have constant variance
- linear relationship between explanatory variable (X) and the mean of the response variable

The last assumption is most straight-forward when you write
$$E[Y_i] = \beta_0+\beta_1X_i.$$

Now we could go through all the formulas related with the SLR model,
but suffice it to say that we can construct confidence intervals and 
hypothesis tests for any $\beta$ and these involve the $T$-distribution. 
Software generally defaults to providing hypothesis tests relative to the 
$\beta$s being 0. 
This makes sense for $\beta_1$ since, if it is 0, then that means the 
explanatory variable has no effect on the response variable. 

All the usual caveats apply for hypothesis tests here. 
Have you read the [ASA Statement on $p$-Values](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)
yet?


### Interpretation

The most useful aspect of SLR models is the simplicity of interpretation:

> For each unit increase in the explanatory variable, the mean of the response variable increases by $\beta_1$.



## Multiple linear regression


Multiple (linear) regression is the extension of the SLR model to more than 
one continuous or binary explanatory variable. 
It also includes quadratic terms as well as interactions. 
Now, for each observation, you need to collect the value of the response 
variable as well as all of the explanatory variables, i.e.
$(Y_i,X_{i,1},\ldots,X_{i,p})$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$. 
(I'm thinking spreadsheets might be pretty handy about now.)


The model can be written 
$$Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1X_{i,p}+\ldots+\beta_p X_{i,p}+\epsilon_i, \qquad \epsilon_i\stackrel{ind}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2).$$
But, it is much more succinct when you use some linear algebra
$$Y = X\beta + e, \quad e \sim N(0,\sigma^2\mathrm{I})$$
but now we have to define 

- vector $Y = (Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)^{\top}$,
- vector $\beta = (\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p)$, 
- vector errors $\epsilon = (\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_n)$,
- model matrix $X$ which is $n \times p$ with each row being the 
- vector $X_i = (X_{i,1},\ldots,X_{i,p})$. 

**Note:** 
the models aren't quite identical since the matrix version does not 
have an explicit intercept, 
but instead you can include an intercept by having the
first column of X be all 1s. 


### Maximum likelihood estimator

Using some linear algebra and assuming we have a full rank $X$, 
the maximum likelihood estimator for $\beta$ is nice and succinct 
$$\hat\beta_{MLE} = (X^\top X)^{-1}X^\top y.$$
How pretty is that!!
(Break this out at parties and impress all your friends.
Don't write it down, just say it.)

### Interpretation

Multiple regression models are much better at representing reality than 
simple linear regression models 
because, generally, 

- there is more than one explanatory variable affecting the response variable and
- relationships between explanatory variables and the response variable is complicated.

With this flexibility, 
we do lose some interpretability. 
If there are no interactions, 
then we can interpret the coefficient for the $j$th explanatory variable like this

> holding all other variables constant, a one unit change in the $j$th explanatory variable increases the mean of the response variable by $\beta_j$.

When you read about this in the newspaper or a journal article,
they will often use the phrase "after adjusting for ..." 
or "after controlling for ...". 

When interactions are present, everything becomes much more complicated. 
Are you ready to use figures yet?



# Visualization

In this section, 
we will visualize a bunch of regression models using the 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package. 
First, we need to load the package

```{r load_ggplot2}
library("ggplot2")  # you may need to install it first using install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Also, the data we will use is the in [Sleuth3](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Sleuth3/index.html) R package, 
so it also needs to be loaded. 

```{r load_Sleuth3}
library("Sleuth3")  # you may need to install it first using install.packages("Sleuth3")
```


## Simple linear regression

We will start with the simple linear regression (SLR) model, 
but using logarithms we will show that there is a lot of flexibility even in 
this relatively trivial model. 
The *simple* in SLR indicates that there is a single explanatory variable and,
typically, it is continuous. 

```{r case0801}
ggplot(Sleuth3::case0801, 
       aes(x = Area, y = Species)) + 
  geom_point() +  
  labs(title = "Number of reptile and amphibian species for West Indies islands") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


### Logarithm of explanatory variable

```{r case0801_log_x}
ggplot(Sleuth3::case0801, 
       aes(x = Area, y = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Number of reptile and amphibian species for West Indies islands") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


### Logarithm of response variable

```{r case0801_log_y}
ggplot(Sleuth3::case0801, 
       aes(x = Area, y = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Number of reptile and amphibian species for West Indies islands") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```


### Logarithm of both response and explanatory variable

```{r case0801_log_xy}
ggplot(Sleuth3::case0801, 
       aes(x = Area, y = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Number of reptile and amphibian species for West Indies islands") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

For good measure, let's run the regression analysis in R

```{r case0801_regression}
m <- lm(log(Species) ~ log(Area), data = Sleuth3::case0801)
summary(m)
```

Since `Species` is a count with no maximum, 
we may really want to run a Poisson regression analysis. 

```{r case0801_poisson_regression}
m <- glm(Species ~ log(Area),      
         data = Sleuth3::case0801,
         family = poisson)
summary(m)
```

### SLR with binary explanatory variable

```{r case0801_binary_x}
ggplot(Sleuth3::case0801, 
       aes(x = 1*I(Area>100), y = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_log10() + 
  labs(title = "Number of reptile and amphibian species for West Indies islands") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```



## Multiple regression

```{r fix_case0901}
library("dplyr") # may need to install.packages("dplyr")
case0901 <- Sleuth3::case0901 %>%
  mutate(Time = ifelse(Time == 1, "Late", "Early"))
```

```{r explore_case0901}
dim(case0901)
summary(case0901)
head(case0901)
```

### SLR

Let's start by ignore `Time`. 

```{r case0901_plot_only_flowers}
ggplot(case0901, 
       aes(x = Intensity, y = Flowers)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Effects of Light on Meadowfoam Flowering") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)
```

```{r case0901_slr_reg}
m <- lm(Flowers ~ Intensity, data = case0901)
summary(m)
```

### Multiple regression

Let's add `Time`

```{r case0901_plot_with_time}
ggplot(case0901, 
       aes(x = Intensity, y = Flowers, color = Time, shape = Time)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Effects of Light on Meadowfoam Flowering") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

By default, `ggplot2::geom_smooth` plots separate lines for the two `Time`s and
thus is equivalent to a model with an interaction between `Time` and `Intensity`.
The fact that these lines look parallel indicates an interaction is not needed.

```{r case0901_reg_with_interaction}
m <- lm(Flowers ~ Intensity*Time, data = case0901)
anova(m)
```

Interaction is not significant, so it will simplify our interpretation if we
exclude it.
(Please note though, that you could keep it in the model.)

```{r case0901_reg}
m <- lm(Flowers ~ Intensity+Time, data = case0901)
anova(m)
summary(m)
```
