\section{Hypothesis Tests}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Hypothesis test for a population mean $\mu$}

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\item Specify the null and alternative hypothesis.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0: \mu = m_0$ is the default or current belief
  \item $H_a: \mu > m_0$ or $\mu<m_0$ or $\mu \ne m_0$ is what you believe
  \end{itemize}
\item Specify a significance level $\alpha$.
\item Calculate the $t$-statistic.
\item Calculate the \pvalue{}.
\item Make a conclusion:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If \pvalue{} $< \alpha$, \alert{reject null hypothesis}.
  \item If \pvalue{} $\ge \alpha$, \alert{fail to reject null hypothesis}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Paired data}

\begin{definition}
Two data sets and \alert{paired} when each data point in one data set is 
related to one, and only one, data point in the other data set. 
\end{definition}

\pause

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Record the moisturizing effect of hand lotion by using the hand lotion
on only one of two hands for each study participant, but measure both hands.
\item Record participant weight before and after a weight loss program.
\item Assess environmental affects by studying identical twins who have grown
up in different households.
\end{itemize}

\pause

Using paired data will increase your \alert{power} where power is the probability 
of reject a null hypothesis that is not true, 
\pause i.e. it is one minus the probability of a Type II error.
\pause
Thus paired data will decrease the probability of a Type II error.

\subsection{Water quality hypothesis test}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Water quality hypothesis test}

\small

The Ames Water Treatment Plant is considering two different processing methods
for removing sediments from drinking water: active vs passive.
\pause
They would like to know which method is better. 
\pause
They set up a pilot study where each method was implemented in parallel 
and observations were taken simultaneously from each method at random times.
\pause
After 25 random times, they find the mean difference (active-passive) is 
77 ppm with a standard deviation of 364 ppm. 

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]
\item Let $\mu$ be the true mean difference (active-passive) in sediment
\item $H_0: \mu = 0$ versus $H_a: \mu \ne 0$
\item $t$-statistic is:
\[ 
t = \frac{77-0}{364/\sqrt{25}} = 1.058
\]
\item \pvalue{} is:
\[
\mbox{\pvalue{}} = 2P(T_{24}>|1.058|) = 0.30 
\]
\item Fail to reject the null of no difference between active and passive methods
based on a significance level $\alpha=0.05$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Water quality confidence interval}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Water quality confidence interval}

\small

The plant manager thinks maybe a confidence interval will show a 
``significant'' result by not including 0.
\pause
So he asks a data scientist to construct a 95\% confidence interval
based on the sample size of $25$, the sample mean of $77$ ppm of the difference
(active-passive), 
and the sample standard deviation of $364$ ppm.  

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

The data scientists finds the $t$-critical value:
\pause 
\[ 
t_{24,0.025} = 2.064
\]
and constructs a confidence interval for the difference (active-passive)
\pause 
\[ 
77 \pm 2.064 \cdot 364/\sqrt{25} = (-73 \mbox{ ppm},227 \mbox{ ppm}).
\]
\pause
This interval includes $0$ which is consistent with no difference, 
\pause
but it is suggestive that the passive method is better
\pause
because lower sediments is better and the interval covers more positive
values than negative values.

\end{frame}


\subsection{Water quality sample size}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Water quality sample size}

\small

The plant manager asks the data scientist how many samples they will need 
to reject the null hypothesis.
\pause
The data scientists finds an online app, 
e.g. \url{https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n1.html},
and plugs in some numbers to find a sample size of $n=176$.

\vspace{0.1in}

\includegraphics{figs/sample_size}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Water quality ample size (cont.)}

\small

The manager asks a statistician to verify this sample size.
\pause
The statistician explains that  with a sample size of $176$ and significance 
level $\alpha=0.05$ we reject if $|t| > 1.984$ since $2P(T_{100}>1.984) = 0.05$.
\pause 
Assuming $X_i \iid N(77, 364^2)$, we have
\[
\frac{\overline{X}-77}{364/\sqrt{176}} \pause 
= \frac{\overline{X}-0}{364/\sqrt{176}}-\frac{77}{364/\sqrt{176}} 
= \pause T_{175} - 2.806 
\sim t_{175}
\]
and the power is
\[ \begin{array}{rl}
\multicolumn{2}{l}{P\left(\frac{\overline{X}-0}{364/\sqrt{176}} < -1.984 \mbox{  or  } 
\frac{\overline{X}-0}{364/\sqrt{176}} > 1.984 \right)} \pause \\ \\
&= \phantom{1-}P\left(T_{175} < -1.984 + 2.806 \mbox{  or  } 
T_{175} > 1.984 + 2.806 \right) \pause \\
&= \phantom{1-}P(T_{175} < 0.822) + P(T_{175} > 4.79) \pause \\
&\approx 1-P(T_{175} > 0.822) + 0 \pause \\
&\approx 1-0.2 \\
&= 0.8
\end{array} \]
\pause
Thus, the app is correct.

\end{frame}



\subsection{Water quality big data}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Water quality big data}

Since samples are automated, 
the manager goes overboard and takes $17,600$ random samples. 
\pause
He doesn't even bother looking at the data or calculating summary statistics.
\pause
Instead, he immediately calculates a pvalue of $0.04$ and rejects the null 
hypothesis of no difference between active and passive 
\pause
and runs around the water treatment plant screaming in excitement. 

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

Had he bothered to calculate summary statistics, he would have found
a mean difference (active-passive) of $4.1$ ppm with a standard deviation of 
$257$ ppm.
\pause
This results in a 95\% confidence interval \pause 
of 
\[
4.1 \pm 1.962 \cdot \frac{257}{\sqrt{17600}} = (0.3 \mbox{ ppm}, 7.9 \mbox{ ppm}).
\]
\pause
Compared to the EPA limit of $500$ ppm, it is likely that even an $8$ ppm difference
is not important.

\end{frame}


\subsection{Summary}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary}

This example demonstrated a 
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between practical and statistical significance
\item Correspondence between confidence intervals and pvalues
\item Informativeness of confidence intervals compared to pvalues
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Practical versus statistical significance}

\begin{definition}
A result is \alert{statistical significant} if your \pvalue{} is less than 
your significance level.
\pause
A result is \alert{practically significant} if the size of the effect is 
meaningful.
\end{definition}

\vspace{0.1in} \pause

In our example, we had two situations:
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item pilot study:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item statistically insignificant result with \pvalue{}$=0.3>0.05$
  \item practically significant result with estimated $77$ ppm difference
  \end{itemize}
\item big data study:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item statistically significant result with \pvalue{}$=0.04<0.05$
  \item practically insignificant result with estimated difference $<8$ ppm
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Correspondence between confidence intervals and pvalues}

For a null hypothesis $H_0: \mu=m_0$ and an alternative hypothesis
$H_a:\mu\ne m_0$ with a \pvalue{} $p$:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item if $p<\alpha$ then a $100(1-\alpha)$\% CI will not include $m_0$
\item if $p\ge \alpha$ then a $100(1-\alpha)$\% CI will include $m_0$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1in}

In our example, we had two situations:
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item pilot study:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \pvalue{}$=0.3>0.05$ and
  \item 95\% CI of ($-73$ ppm,$227$ ppm) included 0
  \end{itemize}
\item big data study:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \pvalue{}$=0.04<0.05$ and
  \item 95\% CI of ($0.3$ ppm, $7.9$ ppm) did not include 0
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reasons to ignore hypothesis tests and \pvalue{}s}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Point null hypotheses, e.g $H_0: \mu = m_0$, are never true
\item A \pvalue{} and decision (reject/fail to reject) is never enough information
\item When we reject, we don't know what assumption is to blame:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\mu=m_0$?
  \item independent and identically distributed with common variance? \pause (random sample)
  \item normal? \pause (procedure is robust)
  \end{itemize}
\item A confidence interval provides an estimate with uncertainty and thus
allows you to assess statistical and practical significance.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
