This page will provide links to code for completing analyses for this class. 

## R analyses

The following provide approaches to analyzing data in R. 
The first link provides the R code and R output as well as a description of what
the code is doing. 
For homework, it will likely be helpful to start with the R script 

- [Installation](installation/installation.html) ([installation.R](installation/installation.R))
- [Binomial analyses](binomial/binomial.html) ([binomial.R](binomial/binomial.R))
- [Normal analyses](normal/normal.html) ([normal.R](normal/normal.R), [normal-data.csv](normal/normal-data.csv)) 
- [Simple linear regression](regression/slr.html) ([slr.R](regression/slr.R))

## Excel anlayses

The following provides approaches to analyzing data in Excel. 
The files are constructed so that you only need to change the red valued cells. 

- [Binomial analyses](binomial/binomial.xlsx)
- [Normal analyses](normal/normal.xlsx)
- [Simple linear regression](regression/slr.xlsx) ([instructions](https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/regression.html) and [options](regression/excel_regression_options.png))
