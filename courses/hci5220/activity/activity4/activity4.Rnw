\section*{Part 1}

We would like to investigate the relationship between calorie intake on
Thanksgiving and expenditures on Black Friday.
The file {\tt thanksgiving.csv} contains (fake) data on calorie intake
and expenditures.
We will run a simple linear regression model using calorie intake as the
independent variable and expenditure as the dependent variable.

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
set.seed(20220301)

thanksgiving <- data.frame(calorie = runif(66, 1000, 3000)) %>%
  mutate(expenditure = rnorm(n(), 1000 - calorie/5, sd = 100),
         calorie = round(calorie),
         expenditure = round(expenditure))

write_csv(thanksgiving, file = "thanksgiving.csv")
@
\end{answer}

Fit the regression model and report the following quantities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimated intercept ($\hat\beta_0$)

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
thanksgiving <- read_csv("thanksgiving.csv")

m <- lm(expenditure ~ calorie, data = thanksgiving)
coef(m)[1]
@
\end{answer}

\item Estimated slope ($\hat\beta_1$)

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
coef(m)[2]
@
\end{answer}

\item 95\% credible interval for the intercept

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
confint(m)[1,]
@
\end{answer}


\item 95\% credible interval for the slope

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
confint(m)[2,]
@
\end{answer}

\item Estimate for the error standard deviation $\hat\sigma$

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
summary(m)$sigma
@
\end{answer}

\item Coefficient of determination $R^2$

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
summary(m)$r.squared
@
\end{answer}

\item Correlation between calorie intake and expenditure

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
cor(thanksgiving$calorie, thanksgiving$expenditure)
@
\end{answer}

\end{enumerate}


\section*{Part II}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide an interpretation for the intercept.

\begin{answer}
If no calories are consumed on Thanksgiving, the expected expenditure is
\$\Sexpr{round(coef(m)[1], 2)}.
Since the lowest calories consumed was about 1,000,
this is extrapolating quite far from our data and therefore is not very
reliable.
\end{answer}

\item Provide an interpretation for the slope.

\begin{answer}
For each additional calorie consumed on Thanksgiving, the expected
reduction in expenditure is \$\Sexpr{-round(coef(m)[2], 2)}.
\end{answer}

\item Provide a scientific explanation for why we might observe this
relationship between calories consumed on Thanksgiving and expenditures on
Black Friday.

\begin{answer}
One plausible explanation is that those who consume more on Thanksgiving are
more sluggish on Black Friday and therefore spend less.
Another plausible explanation is that those who are planning on spending less
time shopping on Black Friday may plan to eat more on Thanksgiving.
\end{answer}

\item Provide a plot of expenditure (y-axis) vs calorie (x-axis) with a
regression line.

\begin{answer}
<<>>=
ggplot(thanksgiving, aes(calorie, expenditure)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
@
\end{answer}


\end{enumerate}
